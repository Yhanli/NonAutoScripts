            "cleanhtml": "<font color=\"#000000\"><p>A four-level office building in Grafton on a site that is zoned for mixed-use development up to a height of 27 metres offers a multitude of options for its next owner.</p><p>The 807 sq m building constructed in 1984 on 615 sq m of freehold land at 79 Grafton Rd is for sale by tender closing 4pm, Tuesday, December 3, 2019 unless sold prior.</p><p>“Available for the first time in over 30 years, this offering provides an opportunity to secure a well maintained standalone building with 14 car parks and profile in a highly convenient and tightly-held CBD fringe location,” says Bayleys senior broker Phil Haydock. He is marketing the property with Bayleys Auckland City &amp; Fringe colleague James Were.</p><p>“Except for one office suite, the property is able to be offered with vacant possession, which makes it an attractive proposition for owner occupiers and add-value investors, particularly as the building has an A Grade seismic assessment.</p><p>“Given its high profile position and favourable Business – Mixed Use zoning, with height variation control permitting development up to 27 metres, the property also has untapped add-value potential for refurbishment, conversion to residential and/or constructing additional floor area.”</p><p>The building is set back slightly from the street frontage, providing room for three parking spaces by the front entrance with a further 11 at the rear of the site. Haydock says the property has been attractively landscaped with the building surrounded by a variety of mature trees.</p><p>It is currently configured into multiple commercial office suites, with individual floors ranging from 166 sq m to 236 sq m. The property is generating short-term holding income of approximately $119,293.</p><p>James Were says this income could be increased relatively quickly by upgrading the office accommodation and leasing up vacant space. However, most of the property’s value lay in the underlying land zoning which allowed for much more intensive development of the underutilised, rectangular site across a wide range of potential commercial and/or residential uses.</p><p>He says the site’s position within the highly sought-after Auckland Grammar School zone increases it attractiveness for residential development. “Its location between Auckland Hospital and the city’s two main universities also means it would be well positioned for student accommodation.</p><p>“It’s in a popular commercial precinct on the CBD border and is also close to Auckland Domain, Newmarket, Parnell and Mt Eden with excellent access also to motorways,” Were says.</p><p>“The Grafton Gully motorway interchange is just down the hill providing connections to the northern, southern and north-western motorway systems. This places Avondale, Greenlane and North Shore all within 10 minutes’ drive off peak. As the CBD and Newmarket expand, so too will the value of this central Auckland location.”</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/grafton-property-provides-plenty-of-possibilities/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

He and colleague Damien Bullick are marketing the property by tender closing at 4pm, September 19, unless sold earlier.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Haydock says the site’s Metropolitan Centre zoning is the most intensive in the central city fringe. It allows for building  to a height of 72.5m, although the Mountain Rd property is subject to viewshaft restrictions of between 19m and 41m metres. </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>“The Metropolitan Centre zoning permits a wide range of intensive activities including commercial, leisure, high-density residential, tourism, cultural, community and civic services,” says Haydock. </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>“One of the features of this site is that it’s zoned for both Auckland Grammar and Epsom Girls’ Grammar schools, which makes it particularly attractive  for residential development.”  </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The resource consent provides for ground floor retail with 10 levels of apartments above on part of the site, plus basement carparking.  </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>“The next owner could activate this consent straight away or look at  more intensive development options. Alternatively, they could utilise the existing buildings for occupation, or to provide income in the medium term, given the expectation that the underlying land value will continue to rise,” says Haydock.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Existing buildings on the site total about  644 sq m. Built in the late 1930s, the main building was later extended and provides 561sq m of office accommodation. There is a large open plan area on the ground level along with a number of partitioned offices and amenities  over two levels.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>There is also an 83sq m single-level brick building at the rear of the site, previously used as a display suite/showroom.   </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>“The main office building has  been home to some high-profile occupants, including Lion Breweries and, in more recent times, Morton Estate, and would suit an owner/occupier looking for premises with a point of difference,” says Bullick. </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>“There also continues to be high demand from tenants for office space that has personality and character and this building certainly fits that description, given its attractive appearance and  features including large windows, high stud and timber flooring. </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>“With some refurbishment, it could provide an opportunity for a developer or add-value investor to generate considerable holding income.”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Access to the property is from Mountain Rd and there is a right of way over the neighbouring property on the northern side of the site. There are 12 open-air car parks at the rear and side of the buildings.  </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The surrounding area contains a mix of modern commercial buildings and apartments.

There is also easy access to  the southern motorway via the nearby Khyber Pass interchange.”</div>\n</div><div>Land in Auckland’s sought-after double-Grammar school zone  is up for sale with resource consent in place for an 11-storey mixed-use development.</div><div></div><div>The property is on an elevated, 1113sq m north-facing site with a mix of character buildings at 2 Mountain Rd, Epsom, around 30m from the intersection with Khyber Pass, and is for sale with vacant possession.</div><div></div><div>This offers an immediate add value or development opportunity, says Bayleys’ Auckland city and fringe director Alan Haydock. He and colleague Damien Bullick are marketing the property by tender closing at 4pm, September 19, unless sold earlier.</div><div></div><div>Haydock says the site’s Metropolitan Centre zoning is the most intensive in the central city fringe. It allows for building  to a height of 72.5m, although the Mountain Rd property is subject to viewshaft restrictions of between 19m and 41m metres. </div><div></div><div>“The Metropolitan Centre zoning permits a wide range of intensive activities including commercial, leisure, high-density residential, tourism, cultural, community and civic services,” says Haydock. </div><div></div><div>“One of the features of this site is that it’s zoned for both Auckland Grammar and Epsom Girls’ Grammar schools, which makes it particularly attractive  for residential development.”  </div><div></div><div>The resource consent provides for ground floor retail with 10 levels of apartments above on part of the site, plus basement carparking.  </div><div></div><div>“The next owner could activate this consent straight away or look at  more intensive development options. Alternatively, they could utilise the existing buildings for occupation, or to provide income in the medium term, given the expectation that the underlying land value will continue to rise,” says Haydock.</div><div></div><div>Existing buildings on the site total about  644 sq m. Built in the late 1930s, the main building was later extended and provides 561sq m of office accommodation. There is a large open plan area on the ground level along with a number of partitioned offices and amenities  over two levels.</div><div></div><div>There is also an 83sq m single-level brick building at the rear of the site, previously used as a display suite/showroom.   </div><div></div><div>“The main office building has  been home to some high-profile occupants, including Lion Breweries and, in more recent times, Morton Estate, and would suit an owner/occupier looking for premises with a point of difference,” says Bullick. </div><div></div><div>“There also continues to be high demand from tenants for office space that has personality and character and this building certainly fits that description, given its attractive appearance and  features including large windows, high stud and timber flooring. </div><div></div><div>“With some refurbishment, it could provide an opportunity for a developer or add-value investor to generate considerable holding income.”</div><div></div><div>Access to the property is from Mountain Rd and there is a right of way over the neighbouring property on the northern side of the site. There are 12 open-air car parks at the rear and side of the buildings.  </div><div></div><div>The surrounding area contains a mix of modern commercial buildings and apartments. A Les Mills fitness centre, which has frontage on to Khyber Pass, is next door, and  directly across the road is St Peters College.

Its chimneys were removed in the 1980s. </div><div></div><div>Since then  its interior has been refurbished and remodelled into professional office suites, including conversion of what was the postmistress’s apartment into workspace.</div><div></div><div>The downsizing and deregulation of the public sector by the Labour Government in the late 1980s — including splitting the Post Office into three separate entities — resulted in the Manukau Rd property being sold into private ownership in 1990.</div><div></div><div>Now it is being marketed for sale at auction on September 18 by Bayleys Auckland. </div><div></div><div>It features in Bayleys’ latest Total Property portfolio magazine.

This can be terminated with one month’s notice by either party. </div><div></div><div>The ground floor and basement, which are divided into a number of bars and function areas and were previously occupied by the  hotel, are being offered with vacant possession. </div><div></div><div>Haydock says the vendor has added considerable value by obtaining consent for a mixed-use redevelopment that would maximize the value of the full site and which could commence almost immediately.</div><div></div><div>However, it would be over to the next owner as to whether they activated that consent or pursued their own plans.</div><div></div><div>“Given the building’s strong location and heritage status, it would suit a wide range of uses. An owner occupier could create bespoke  premises for their business, making full use of the  building,” says Haydock.</div><div></div><div>Another resource consent was also issued in 2011 to subdivide the ground floor and basement areas into multiple retail tenancies, utilising the building’s extensive glazing along Parnell Rd as  shop windows. This consent is valid until 2021. </div><div></div><div>Melhuish says the building was extensively refurbished internally and externally to a high standard in 2000 with the upper level converted to character office space. </div><div></div><div>“Structural strengthening was undertaken as part of this refurbishment and its seismic assessment of 53.9 per cent of New Building Standard (NBS) is good for a building of this age.”</div><div></div><div>“A subsequent owner has taken measures to further strengthen the property to increase the seismic rating to 100 per cent of NBS. Some of the work needed to do this has already been undertaken and could be completed as part of any future upgrading of the building.” </div><div></div><div>The current Windsor Castle hotel was built constructed in the early 1850s and is one of Auckland’s oldest remaining brick buildings. </div><div></div><div>Originally constructed as a Georgian drinking house, the hotel was remodelled in the 1880s when architect, R. MacKay Fripp was commissioned to create a large Victorian corner pub. An elaborate Italianate facade was added which still dominates its appearance.</div><div></div><div>Heritage New Zealand bestowed a Historic Place Category 1 classification on the building in 1997, saying it makes a strong contribution to the streetscape of Parnell and adds considerably to the historic character of the suburb.</div><div></div><div>“Over its life, the building has been added to and refurbished but many of its character attributes have been maintained,”</div><div>says Melhuish. “Given the exterior of the building has the highest possible historical protection, any further work needs to be respectful of that.” </div><div></div><div>The ground floor layout features a restaurant area, which is accessed off the ornate corner entrance to the building and includes an adjacent outdoor dining space. Beside this is a bar with a courtyard and a separate entrance from Parnell Rd. </div><div></div><div>The ground floor also contains a commercial kitchen and cold storage as well as additional storage space and an office. There is currently stacked parking for six cars off Windsor Street. </div><div></div><div>A 36sq m basement area was the Windsor Castle’s original cellar. More recently it has been used as a private function room. </div><div></div><div>The upper level has its own separate access and comprises character offices. “This floor provides elegant, high stud office accommodation with original polished wooden tongue and groove flooring,” says Melhuish. </div><div></div><div>Haydock says the property is superbly positioned on a high profile corner site at the CBD end of Parnell’s main thoroughfare, close to some of Auckland’s best restaurants, cafes, bars and shops. “It is also within easy walking distance of multiple public transport options, including the Parnell train station.”</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/wet-your-whistle-future-options-for-windsor-castle/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

            "cleanhtml": "<font color=\"#000000\"><p>Demand for industrial property within the golden triangle is underpinned by activity at Tauranga port.</p><p>Experts from New Zealand’s largest full-service real estate agency have produced the first in a series of reports examining the impact of infrastructure development on the commercial and industrial market.</p><p>Bayleys Infrastructure Series will focus on how initiatives being rolled out throughout the country will influence commercial real estate.</p><p>The series is being spearheaded by Ryan Johnson, Bayleys director commercial and industrial, and Ian Little, director of Bayleys Research. They’re supported by divisional heads across the 16 service arms of Bayleys.</p><p>Johnson says New Zealand’s economic growth, low unemployment rate, historically low interest rates, and active development sector are all contributing to change across the property sectors.</p><p>Infrastructure is also playing a role. “While in many parts of the country there’s an infrastructural catch-up game underway, in other cases, infrastructure programmes are leading the way and determining new growth areas,” he says.</p><p>“This is particularly true for the industrial market where burgeoning logistics and supply chain operations, a thriving primary sector and e-commerce trends are driving property expansion into former greenfield sites, once largely rural areas such as Drury, south of Auckland, and into the regions.”</p><p>He says large-scale infrastructure projects will have a significant impact on the built-environment, help improve productivity, and have the potential to redefine towns and cities.</p><p>The first report in the series looks at New Zealand’s economic “golden triangle” — the Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions — and profiles industrial property fundamentals within that area.</p><p>The triangle houses the majority of the nation’s population, generates most of New Zealand’s gross domestic product, and is in scale-up mode.</p><p>“Recent years have seen high levels of business expansion and job creation within the zone and this has in turn fuelled demand for workspace and driven a surge in development activity,” says Johnson.</p><p>“Demand for industrial property within the golden triangle is underpinned by the country’s two busiest sea ports — Tauranga and Auckland — and the country’s largest international gateway Auckland airport.</p><p>“Unprecedented growth in this evolving zone means that much of the national infrastructure spend is being directed towards the golden triangle, reflecting the pivotal role it plays in New Zealand’s economy.”</p><p>Ian Little says New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) figures show that 56 per cent of national freight movements pass through the upper North Island, while about 35 per cent of the country’s exports go through Tauranga’s port.</p><p>“Given these fundamentals it is not surprising that, of the $129 billion earmarked for infrastructure projects over the next 10 years, about $100 billion is to be spent on projects within the golden triangle, with $55 billion on roading and land transport projects,” says Little.</p><p>Major projects include the $2 billion Waikato Expressway and the $268 million Southern Corridor Improvements Project covering the stretch of Southern Motorway (SH1) from the SH20/ SH1 connection at Manukau to Papakura.</p><p>These initiatives have been preceded by the Western Ring Route, an alternative motorway connecting new industrial precincts in the north/ northwest with the airport and south Auckland industrial precincts.</p><p>The most significant project in the Bay of Plenty is the $102 million Baypark to Bayfair upgrade, where two flyovers built on SH2 by 2020 will improve the route to the port of Tauranga and complete what is known as the ‘Eastern Corridor’. <br/>Scott Campbell, Bayleys' national director industrial and logistics, says despite a sharp uplift in industrial development within the golden triangle, heightened demand has run ahead of new supply.</p><p>“Bayleys Research vacancy surveys show the combined vacancy rate across the three cities was historically low at just 1.8 per cent, with marked decreases noted across each city,” says Campbell.</p><p>“The development sector has responded to a call for space and we’ve seen construction activity ramping up over the last two years.</p><p>“However, a shortage of development land has been a handbrake in the Auckland market and the rising cost of land has forced development outwards to the fringes.”<br/>Campbell says the Waikato freight hub in Horotiu and the planned Ruakura inland port will address some of that region’s shortfall.</p><p>“These new hubs will bring logistical and supply chain benefits, a lowering of freight costs and, through the better utilisation of rail, a reduction in carbon emissions.”</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/market-news/dynamics-of-the-golden-triangle/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Te Mānia was established in 1990 and Richmond Plains a year later. Richmond Plains produced New Zealand’s first certified organic sauvignon blanc and pinot noir.</p><p>Appleby Vintners leases three organic vineyards on the Waimea Plains with a total of 12.7ha planted in pinot noir, sauvignon blanc and chardonnay with small areas of pinot gris, riesling, merlot, malbec and cabernet franc.</p><p>In addition, it leases a cellar door and a 200-tonne building off Appleby Highway, 11km from Nelson airport. The cellar door is particularly well placed for direct-to-consumer sales to the growing Nelson tourism market. “This is a rare opportunity for a young winemaker to hit the ground running, buying an established wine company that leases rather than owns its vineyards and winery,” said Laven.</p><p>“For a relatively low entry cost, a young winemaker or viticulturist can buy this business which provides reasonably consistent domestic and export sales of two well-known Nelson organic wine brands. The structure of the current leases means there is a lot of flexibility for a new owner and scope to take the business in new directions.”</p><p>According to New Zealand Wine, 10 per cent of New Zealand wineries now hold organic certification.</p><p>“The market for organic wines is definitely growing, not just here but throughout the world, as environmentally-conscious consumers are increasingly concerned about personal health and looking after the planet,” Laven says.</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/prized-nelson-wine-brands-on-the-market/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

After further negotiations the property came back on the market at $43.5m and sold under the hammer.</p><p>David Bayley later noted its significance, saying: “Despite the challenges the property market is currently facing, we had widespread interest in the site and most of New Zealand’s most prominent property players were at the auction.</p><p>“We see a sale of this scale as a big vote of confidence in the long-term future of Auckland’s CBD.”</p><p>The 125 properties and businesses on offer in the first of the 2010 Total Property portfolios was hailed by Bayleys as the biggest ever produced for that time of year.</p><p>The buyer response showed a confidence that belied the brittle environment as the economy struggled to muster a post-GFC recovery.</p><p>In his magazine welcome, Bayleys managing director Mike Bayley wrote that “a realigning of business activities means ‘fringe' properties not essential to core business will continue to be sold off as part of corporate rationalisation”.</p><p>The sale of New Zealand Retail Property Group's holdings of shops in the Westgate Shopping Centre in Massey, Auckland, and the Fraser Cove Shopping Centre in Tauranga, was one of this country’s biggest sell-downs of retail property.</p><p>Some 20 sales, totalling $64m, were completed, with tenants reading like a ‘Who’s Who’ of retail.</p><p>In June 2014, four industrial properties owned by Bell Tea were listed for sale by international tender.</p><p>The four-page Total Property spread and marketing saw 99 parties quickly register interest. The properties, including two plants which produced three million tea bags a day, were sold to different buyers for $18.65m. The largest sale of $10.8m was achieved for Bell’s main production plant and head office, one of three portfolio properties in East Tamaki, Auckland.</p><p>All three sold with 12-year leases plus rights of renewal extending into the 2030s. <br/>The 5463sq m head office, on a 1.3745ha site, sold at a 5.8 per cent yield.</p><p>Also included was Bell’s 95-year-old, 2623sq m processing and warehouse facility in Hope St, Dunedin. It was designed and built for Bell in 1924 and added to in the 1950s and 1980s.</p><p>The four-level property, which required seismic strengthening, sold with vacant possession for $335,000 to Dunedin developer Peter Gullen.</p><p>But it was a KFC site in Porirua that was arguably the most fiercely-contested of Total Property auctions in April last year.</p><p>The 230sq m restaurant, on a 1855sq m corner site beside the North City shopping centre, came with a six-year lease to Restaurant Brands, plus a 12-year right of renewal.</p><p>The auction ran for 45 minutes, with 168 bids, before the restaurant was sold by Mark Sherlock of Bayleys Wellington to a local investor for $2.75m, well above its rateable value of $1.57m, at a yield of 4.91 per cent.</p><p>Auctioneer Richard Valintine says the price vindicated the sales method. “If we were selling this by private treaty, the vendor might have been comfortable to accept a lesser price, thinking that’s an acceptable yield. But an auction is about letting the market speak.”</p><p>Another flurry of interest greeted the former Turakina Māori Girls’ College, near Marton after appearing in Total Property in February 2018.</p><p>Twelve buildings totalling 3000sq m on 5.16ha of freehold land included classrooms, dormitories, a hall and gymnasium, kitchen, swimming pool, chapel and sports fields.</p><p>Bayleys Palmerston North director Karl Cameron said at the time it was a virtual “turn-key” operation which could sustain food and beverage, accommodation and educational services.</p><p>It was steeped in culture, with a chapel and carved waharoa (framed entrances), pou whenua (totem poles), tukutuku (flax wall tapestries) and kowhaiwhai (carved or painted wooden beams).</p><p>It was sold by tender to Rangitīkei iwi Ngāti Apa and the iwi later announced plans for an education, training and employment centre. Property records show it changed hands for $450,000.</p><p>One quirky transaction saw the sale of sheep-shaped buildings which helped spark Tirau’s reinvention as the world’s “corrugated iron capital”.</p><p>The iron-clad buildings, on a 2103sq m corner site on State Highway 1, were sold for an undisclosed sum in late 2016. The capital value was recorded as $1.16m. <br/>The landmark ASB Bank, in Napier’s CBD, was the latest in a string of historic buildings for sale in the city when listed in August 2018.</p><p>The 87-year-old, two-storey building with a Category 1 heritage listing is one of about 140 buildings that rose from the ashes of the 1931 earthquake in art deco or Spanish mission design. The strengthened building, with a 1038sq m floor area and ASB as lead tenant, was sold by salesperson Sam MacDonald for $2.65m.</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/auctions-driving-landmark-sales/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The three properties feature in Bayleys latest Total Property portfolio magazine.</div><div></div><div>“There is considerable diversity within these three listings,” Mr McColl said, “offering multiple risk-appetite and development opportunities for the full  spectrum of buyers in the commercial property sector – ranging from owner/occupiers and passive investors through to developers,” Mr McColl said.</div><div></div><div>Heading the list is a substantial 4,592 square metre industrial warehousing and factory complex at 32 Bentley Street spread across three titles, and sustaining some 2,056 square metres of high-stud buildings. The land is zoned for industrial use under the Masterton District Council plan.</div><div></div><div>“The three modern units are built around a recently-sealed yard, and are fully tenanted with six lease agreements – generating a net income of $94,500 plus GST per annum,” Mr McColl said.</div><div></div><div>“Additionally, the block adjoins some 750 square metres of currently bare land which could sustain either the addition of another warehousing unit with access directly off Bentley Street.”</div><div></div><div>Anchor tenant at the property is national water services infrastructure management company City Care. Other tenants within the property include a gymnasium and fitness centre, an event equipment hireage firm, and a metalwork engineering shop.</div><div></div><div>Next up in the portfolio is the land and purpose-built buildings housing the Masterton location of nationwide motor vehicle testing agency VTNZ at 157 Ngaumutawa Road.</div><div></div><div>VTNZ is currently on a lease running through to 2021 with two further three-year rights of renewal currently generating a net rental of $80,700 plus GST per annum. VTNZ is New Zealand’s biggest vehicle assessment network – conducting inspections on  more than 1.5 million cars, trucks, trailers and caravans annually, in addition to undertaking more than 200,000 practical driver tests.</div><div></div><div>Operating in New Zealand since 1994, VTNZ services both private and commercial vehicle users. The Masterton branch is one of 82 VTNZ locations within New Zealand.</div><div></div><div>Mr McColl said tenant VTNZ Masterton benefitted from the site’s prominent exposure to the State Highway 2 bypass. Zoned for industrial use, the VTNZ site is located next to Masterton’s big box retail and industrial precinct.</div><div></div><div>“The purpose-built design of the 2,812 square metre property sustains easy access off and entry onto, the busy Ngaumutawa Road – with the orientation of the premises allowing customer’s vehicular traffic to flow smoothly in to and out of the VTNZ testing centre workshop. This ensures maximum efficiency for both VTNZ’s mechanics, and customers,” he said.</div><div></div><div>Rounding out the properties is the one of the most well-known retail buildings within Masterton’s central business district – five shops housed in what was formerly known as the State Theatre at 25 – 33 Queen Street.

It is open seven days a week, from 11am until late.</div><div></div><div>Inspired by the Argentinian Asado, NOA’s menu showcases the best of barbecue, with influences from across Latin America, North America and the Mediterranean.</div><div></div><div>Giles says Asado is cooking in its purest form — “just wood fire, grill and meat. NOA is also very well-known for its gourmet burgers and wide selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks”.</div><div></div><div>The business is located in The Eatery, a shared eating space in the vein of Ponsonby Central and next door to numerous shops and the New World Eastridge supermarket.</div><div></div><div>Eastridge is the main shopping centre at the top of Mission Bay’s  Patterson Ave and enjoys views back down to the water and across to Rangitoto Island.</div><div></div><div>“This is a busy shopping destination with the main New World of the area located here, along with Paper Plus and a number of smaller speciality shops,” says Giles.</div><div></div><div>“The eatery is a fantastic addition to Eastridge and is home to seven exciting dining concepts, all different and of high quality.</div><div></div><div>“NOA is located right in the heart of The Eatery, is the largest offering here, and enjoys a full liquor licence.”</div><div></div><div>The business has three separate serving areas and a variety of seating on all three sides. Thirty seats belong to the restaurant but there are a further 80 communal seats. At the front of the restaurant, at the main counter, there are booths and stools overlooking the kitchen, says Giles.</div><div></div><div>“Adjacent to this area is the bar area with its row of beer taps.</div><div></div><div>“Bar stools and leaners dominate this area but it also flows in to the main communal seating area of The Eatery. </div><div></div><div>“There is further seating outside that is both sheltered from wind and rain and nicely heated for the colder  months.”</div><div></div><div>Giles says the owners have been surprised at the food to beverage mix which stands at around 55 per cent in favour of beverage sales.</div><div></div><div>They offer on tap a craft selection of beers and even feature a “beer tasting tray”. </div><div></div><div>Ten staff are usually on duty with four in the kitchen, five at the front of house and there’s a venue manager. Five of the staff hold general manager’s certificates.</div><div></div><div>“It is a strong team with an exceptional Asado grill chef leading the charge in the fire pit,” says Giles.</div><div></div><div>“The NOA concept is nicely bedded-in and the restaurant group is now looking for a dynamic franchisee to take over the reins of this bustling, casual restaurant and bar.</div><div></div><div>“While the business is now ticking along nicely, there are very real growth opportunities here. </div><div></div><div>“There will be summer events held at The Eatery, there is the possible of opening the offering to deliveries, and then specialist classes are also on the cards, such as BBQ masterclasses and cocktail events.”</div><div></div><div>NAZAR Group is the creation of husband and wife team Alex Isik and Nigar Ivgen and counts successful eateries Devon on the Wharf, Deco Eatery, Bodrum Kitchen and Miss Istanbul among its brands.</div><div></div><div>The group will give support and training to the new operator and while you need not have huge amounts of hospitality experience, Giles says  “you will need to be a dynamic individual who loves building relationships with customers\".</div><div></div><div>“The perfect operator for this business will be someone who enjoys the hustle and bustle of a busy and social environment.</div><div></div><div>“Most of the customers are  regulars so you will quickly build friendships — this is a fun business.”</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/burger-bar-franchise-comes-with-tasty-treats/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The sale includes  offices, boardroom, meeting rooms, training rooms with cafeteria, and amenities. </div><div> </div><div>Selling agents Laurie Burt, Ranjan Unka and Daniel Henderson said the quality of the building and the flexibility of the layout  meant it would appeal to a wide range of owner occupiers, developers or  investors.</div><div></div><div>“A unique aspect of the sale is that it will also include an extensive office fit-out, quality furniture, fixtures and fittings, and warehouse racking offering a turnkey opportunity,”  Henderson said.</div><div></div><div>“The premises could continue in its present sole-tenant structure with a large administrative area supporting the logistics activities of the adjacent warehouse, or it could be reconfigured into multiple tenancies.</div><div></div><div>“Separating the complex into smaller units would allow the utilisation of the existing fit-out and continue the office-based commercial space in its current format. Within that, there is the possibility of creating several smaller tenancies in the existing space.</div><div></div><div>“This versatility for multiple uses and tenancies is underpinned by the premises having dual vehicular access points off Argus Pl and substantial car parking, both open-air and under cover.”</div><div> </div><div>Henderson said that repurposing the  infrastructure  could suit alternative owner occupiers including churches, medical, education, entertainment or recreational facilities.  </div><div> </div><div>Burt said the  location on a suburban arterial route also allowed for any new tenant to install prominent naming rights signage on to two street fronts.</div><div></div><div>“Argus Pl sits directly on the boundary separating the residential portion of Hillcrest from the light industrial Porana Rd precinct, consisting predominantly of small-to-medium sized construction, automotive, engineering and retail tenancies.</div><div></div><div>“The property is being offered complete with an extensive floor-to-ceiling racking system in the warehouse — delivering a virtual turn-key operation for a logistics and stock-movement business.</div><div></div><div>“The location has easy access to the Northern Motorway and is surrounded by car parking for some 101 vehicles, including numerous covered spaces.”</div><div> </div><div>Unka said the periphery of the property along the Sunnnybrae Rd frontage had been landscaped with large rocks and shrubs  to enhance the office’s aesthetics and ensure a smooth visual transition  between Hillcrest’s industrial and residential neighbourhoods.</div><div></div><div>“The imposing A-grade office and warehousing complex is one of the biggest commercial sites of its type in the Porana Rd periphery,  offering space in an area that has a vacancy rate of only 2.2 per cent,” he said.</div><div></div><div>“Seldom do you see such substantial properties being available in this  tightly held area.

There is also untapped rental potential  within the offering.</div><div></div><div>Mitchell Wallace and Blair Young, of Bayleys Canterbury, say that despite the rise of e-commerce and changing retail patterns around New Zealand, provincial centres like Timaru have retained thriving main shopping streets. </div><div></div><div>“We can’t underestimate the role that main streets play in these smaller towns and cities,” says Wallace. “Stafford St has been at the heart of the Timaru district since the 1860s, after many of its earlier timber buildings were replaced with those of local blue stone and brick after  fire swept through the street in 1868.</div><div></div><div>“There’s plenty of character, charm and a true feeling of community engendered here.” The properties for sale are home to Whitcoulls, Noel Leeming, BNZ and Trade Aid, with Wilson Parking managing the roof-top parking component.</div><div></div><div>Farmers, Ballantynes, Rebel Sport, Glassons and Kathmandu are all close by, along with  the major trading banks.</div><div></div><div>Young says the five buildings  are arranged in a 'U-shape' and benefit from three street access points. </div><div></div><div>“The buildings are generally in good order, with the Stafford St buildings recently reroofed, the roof-top parking area recently resealed and all buildings strengthened to a minimum of 67 per cent new build standard (NBS).”</div><div></div><div>Timaru  council is developing a ‘city hub strategy’ to maintain a resilient city centre in the face of changing consumer patterns and expectations around sustainability.</div><div></div><div>“This bodes well for the new owner of this  property portfolio as it confirms that investment and new ideas will support the ongoing vibrancy of the location,” says Wallace.</div><div></div><div>Collectively, the property returns $548,092.32 net of all outgoings per annum. Whitcoulls has six years  to run on its lease, Noel Leeming and BNZ have four years to run, after BNZ took an early three-year renewal, while Wilson Parking is on a monthly tenancy. </div><div></div><div>An additional 103.57sq m of prime Stafford St frontage is leased to Trade Aid, expiring in May 2020. Should Trade Aid not seek a new lease, this is potentially an opportunity to increase rental income. A full tenancy schedule is available on request. </div><div></div><div>With the exception of 363sq m occupied by BNZ on the floor above its  storefront, the first floor of each of the buildings is vacant. This includes more than 1000sqm in the rear building which has direct roof-top parking access via a lift and stairs. </div><div></div><div>“While this space would benefit significant refurbishment, its concrete floors and generous ceiling height would be suitable for a gym, community centre, or entertainment uses, as well as more conventional office accommodation,” says Young.</div><div></div><div>“Some restructuring of the Noel Leeming tenancy in conjunction with previous food court space could provide further upside for an investor.”</div><div></div><div>Wallace and Young believe this provincial retail portfolio will  have nationwide appeal.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/timaru-offers-untapped-potential/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Says Colliers International broker Danny Blair, who is marketing the property: “It  is offered for sale with vacant possession, allowing a new owner to immediately add value through repositioning or redeveloping.</div><div></div><div>“There is particularly good conversion potential, given the lack of residential and short-stay accommodation in central Hastings.</div><div></div><div>“Preliminary architectural plans, commissioned by the vendor, envision a 22-unit apartment conversion on the first floor.</div><div></div><div>“A new owner could develop these plans to create a boutique accommodation offering with undeniable heritage appeal. “Alternatively, there is scope to reposition the property as a character office space.”</div><div></div><div>The property is a short distance to the town centre and only a one-minute walk to Bay Plaza,  the largest food court in the Hawke’s Bay.</div><div></div><div>Blair says the property has played a crucial role in Hastings’ municipal history. “The first post office on the site was built in 1910, after the previous building on Station St became too small.</div><div></div><div>“It was designed by government architect John Campbell, who included a clock tower in the Edwardian Baroque style.” The 1914 Hawke’s Bay earthquake rattled the building so badly that the clock chimed more than 100 times, prompting fears the tower might collapse  in another quake.</div><div></div><div>Alterations to address public safety concerns were followed by further work in 1928. Three years later the building was badly damaged in the 1931 earthquake. </div><div></div><div>It was rebuilt without a clock tower in 1932.

Two units have been completed —  one is tenanted and the other is for lease.</div><div></div><div>The two are the first stage of a five-unit development  at 12 Nau Mai Rd, about 10 minutes from Raglan's main commercial area.</div><div></div><div>The  beachside town, 48km west of Hamilton, is booming through tourism and commuters moving from Hamilton. But  there hasn’t been high demand until recently for industrial premises.</div><div></div><div>To fit with what Bayleys Hamilton salesperson Jordan Metcalfe says is Raglan’s “natural ethos”, the developer hasn't built a standard shed with a wire fence. </div><div></div><div>“He had it designed with some key features and almost residential-style architecture in mind,” said  Metcalfe, who is marketing unit one for lease.</div><div></div><div>“Surrounded by a natural stream on the western boundary, a pond to the north and east of the site, and extensive native planting, the 307sq m  unit one is split into a 210sq m  high-stud warehouse, a 47sq m  showroom/office and a 50sq m  one-bedroom apartment.” The unit has three-phase power,   fibre internet, and clearlite at the ends of the warehouse to bring in natural light. </div><div></div><div>Two 3.6m  roller doors provide access to the warehouse.   Other doors can be put in, said  Metcalfe. There is also a secure yard with drive-through access.</div><div></div><div>“The warehouse was designed so it can be split into smaller tenancies and the offices and apartment can each be leased separately, or one tenant can take the entire building,” he said. </div><div></div><div>“The apartment would give a tenant a great live and work lifestyle. This property is as practical as it is aesthetically pleasing. The developer has put a lot of effort into the landscaping and overall set up of the site in order to align with Raglan’s natural ethos.”</div><div></div><div>At a yearly rental of $45,286 plus GST and outgoings,  Metcalfe said the property is suited to a range of businesses, light industries, and tradesmen, particularly as work has started on a 500-house subdivision nearby.</div><div> </div><div>The subdivision  has also created its own infrastructure, including new roading and a bridge. “Tradies are always needed,”  Metcalfe said. “The industrial park is well positioned to service Hamilton, which is 30 minutes away, and the wider golden triangle of Tauranga, Hamilton and Auckland.”</div><div></div><div>Unit two has been leased to Milkbar, a New Zealand on-line maternity clothing and breastfeeding accessories company. “The company owners wanted to live in Raglan, so this is an ideal set-up for them.”</div><div>For unit one, the property owner would prefer a three-year or longer lease, but is open to options, Metcalfe said.</div><div></div><div>No time frame has been yet for completion of the other three  units. “There are not a lot of industrial businesses in Raglan, but a company looking for cheaper rent and new premises with a housing component  could find the development suits them, particularly as the developer is open to most types and sizes of configuration,” Metcalfe said.  </div><div></div><div>Known for its famous surf breaks, arts and crafts and cafes and restaurants, about 5000 people live in Raglan. </div><div></div><div>While many work locally a significant number commute daily to Hamilton. Visitors to the town over summer swell its population by 300-400 per cent.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/industrial-unit-surrounded-by-water-and-extensive-native-planting-fitting-a-natural-ethos-for-lease/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The property features in Bayleys’ latest Total Property portfolio magazine.</div><div></div><div>“The Glenview Holiday Park’s accommodation business is sustained by a broad range of ‘guests’ – ranging from referrals from Government agencies, through to short-term contract workers in the forestry sector,” Mr Smith said.</div><div></div><div>“Those forestry contractors include seedling planters and personnel involved in the logging and harvesting processes. Many of them come in from overseas specifically for short-term contracts. As both activities have different seasons, their work scheduling makes for a consistent workforce stream staying at Glenview throughout the calendar year.</div><div></div><div>“The variety of accommodation stock on offer at Glenview – from conventional style homes through to lodge and dormitory style units - means that multiple demographic groups can be housed simultaneously.</div><div></div><div>“That freedom to ‘juggle’ the appropriate accommodation offering to the appropriate clientele has seen the Glenview maintain an annual occupancy rate of approximately 92 percent.</div><div></div><div>“Meanwhile, the proximity of the Glenview campground to Tokoroa’s various shop and supermarket amenities means there is no need for the holiday park to run a grocery or take-away outlet - which many similar such operations around the country do. Instead, Glenview’s owner/managers have concentrated totally on the core business activity of providing accommodation services.”</div><div></div><div>As a market segment, tourists and holiday-makers now comprise less than five percent of Glenview’s clientele. The business operates it’s a shuttle bus for ferrying guests to workplace locations, and for transporting children staying at the venue to and from school.</div><div></div><div>A graveled, looping, internal roading network at Glenview links the caravan and tent sites with the campground’s amenity blocks. Mr Keane said a considerable amount of land within the flat contoured park was currently underutilised – offering any new owner the potential to increase the number of either portacabins, relocatable dwellings, or caravans available to lease.</div><div></div><div>“There is demand from existing clientele market sectors for more facilities to house both Government agency referrals and the region’s seasonal workforce – particularly in light of both the Government’s ‘billion trees’ policy, and the dairying sector looking to add more forestry to its fringe land-usage,” Mr Keane said.</div><div></div><div>“In parallel, Tokoroa’s central location just a short drive from both Rotorua and Taupo means the town is a hub emergency accommodation overflows from both centres,” he said.</div><div></div><div>“The property’s current owners have developed the Glenview’s present operating model to deliver a strong cash-flow. The opportunity is there now for any new owner to ramp up the portfolio of accommodating services to a greater degree through intensification of land-use intensification.</div><div></div><div>“This could be implemented either in a phased basis, or over a short time-frame.”</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/short-term-housing-and-worker-accommodation-business-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The only new office development currently underway is 55 Corinthian Drive (6,500m2) due for completion mid-2020 and largely pre-committed.”</p><p>Henderson the supply shortage is pushing rentals up across most parts of the North Shore with the best quality office space in Takapuna and Albany being generally leased at between $275 and $350 per sq m and from $210-$275 per sq m for secondary space. Operating expenses (including utility services, insurance and rates), which tenants pay in most leases, are higher in Takapuna at $60-$95 per sq m than in Albany where they range from $50-$75 per sq m.</p><p>Car parking in office buildings is also considerably more expensive in Takapuna at $35-$60 per space per week than in Albany where it mostly sits at $15-35 per week. <br/>Exacerbating the supply shortage on the North Shore office market has been the increase in leasing activity over the past 6-12 months amongst existing tenants as well as new players, says Henderson. These include Comworth Group, Penguin Random and Fuel 50 in Takapuna plus Plan B and Auckland Transport in Albany.</p><p>No new office development is currently underway although a number of opportunities exist, says Henderson. These include the redevelopment of the former Takapuna Council building at 1 The Strand, Takapuna. Although the Council’s lease runs for another couple of years, it has almost fully vacated the premises and sub-leased part of the space to a number of large office tenants.</p><p>Henderson says the Hong Kong based owner of the 10,000sq m-plus property has yet to announce plans for the site. “In light of the current shortage of quality office space in Takapuna, coupled with the property’s central location and proximity to the beach, any future upgrade of the building is likely to attract a wide range of tenant interest.”</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/supply-squeeze-pushes-rentals-up/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

A shamrock graces the Art Deco façade as a nod to the Irish roots of the North Island's former name, New Munster. The law firm bought Munster Chambers in 1977.</p><p>The final addition came in 1992, when Sainsbury Logan &amp; Williams bought the Anglican church's former office building on Cathedral Lane.</p><p>All three buildings are now interconnected. Munster Chambers was joined to the main building in 1981 and the Anglican church office in 2007. The buildings are now in good hands, with Matthews able to draw on his experience of owning historic Turville House in Plimmerton, Porirua.</p><p>Located high on a hill at 75 Motuhara Rd, the house was built between 1907 and 1910 by Sir George Troup, then the chief architect for NZ Railways.</p><p>It shares many design features with Dunedin Railway Station, which Sir George also built in 1907. He later went on to become Wellington Mayor from 1927 to 1931.</p><p>Matthews and his wife Gayle O'Brien bought the house and spent nine months restoring it over 2004 and 2005.

Photo / Getty Images</p><p>Driven by rapid innovations in technology and almost unfettered global connectivity, our physical and digital experiences are merging ever closer. The age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is now truly upon us.</p><p>While the Third Industrial Revolution was also digital in nature, it took a far more linear form. The Fourth, by contrast, is characterised by the synchronisation of rapidly-changing digital technologies. This has already created seismic shifts to the way we live, and is now influencing the way we work.</p><p>We have quickly become accustomed to tapping into technology to personalise and control everyday experiences.</p><p>We map out the quickest route and gauge the traffic before leaving; we control temperatures and answer the door at home while we're away; and when we travel, we take it for granted that our preferences will be catered for. So it's only natural that we should carry these expectations through to the workplace.</p><p>A recent JLL and CoreNet Global survey found that 85 per cent of executives believe smart building solutions can directly benefit worker satisfaction and therefore productivity.</p><p>The implementation of technologies like the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, automation and Virtual Reality means buildings are getting smart enough to adapt to our personal needs.</p><p>We can now reserve workstations for the day with our phones, walk into rooms that adjust the temperature to our liking, visit coffee stations that automatically prepare our favourite brew, or connect wirelessly to a nearby whiteboard.</p><p>If we can do this now, what does this mean for the future of work? Will we simply, as the dystopian theory goes, end up outsmarting and ultimately replacing ourselves?</p><p>Robots have been prevalent in manufacturing for years, and now automation is impacting jobs.</p><p>Repetitive tasks, such as compliance reporting and data registration, are being automated through cognitive computing and Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Virtual assistants and virtual robotic agents can now have voice chats with customers.</p><p>One of our Australian offices recently unveiled their new receptionist (which admittedly is still somewhat of a novelty) 'JiLL', a 57cm-tall robot with inbuilt software that helps it to recognise employees. It can also carry out basic tasks such as meeting and greeting guests and providing directions.</p><p>However, while technology may alter how work gets done, it is unlikely that robots will displace us all. The most likely scenario is that new jobs will emerge, and the work that people and machines do will become more interconnected. This will still require a human touch.</p><p>Given the speed of change, it's impossible to predict what questions we will be asking 10 years from now about the future's future.</p><p>The only prediction we can make safely now is that technology will continue to be a disruptive force, and that resistance to the changes it brings will be fruitless.</p><p>Real estate's potential to help organisations harness this digital transformation to achieve their potential is bigger than it has ever been — and this is only the beginning.</p><p>But this will require collaboration across multiple sectors to ensure advances retain and respect that key balance between the personalised and the personal.</p><p>We are on an exciting journey, to which we don't yet know the destination. The most important thing we can do now is to spark conversations, maintain dialogue, and remain focused on collectively meeting the challenge of keeping pace with significant change.</p><p><em>- Todd Lauchlan is managing director of JLL NZ</em></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/market-news/why-the-human-touch-will-still-determine-the-future-of-work/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Each suite can comfortably seat 10 members with an option to increase space if needed.</p><p>Co-working space is a rapidly growing segment of the city's office market.

The Hangar co-working space is located in a character building just 25 metres away from the water's edge.</p><p>The co-working space is purely there to deliver the basics of operational requirements and its bespoke fitout it designed to provide innovation, energy and a collaborative environment to work in. It was designed by Cheshire Architects, a firm that played a leading role in the redevelopment of the city's downtown historic Britomart precinct.</p><p>\"It is the type of space that will appeal to tenants looking for site that is well connected to Auckland's north-west. For businesses that thrive in character buildings, it will offer the opportunity for social connection and a strong interaction between occupants,\" Mr Gilbert-Smith said.</p><p>\"There is limited character space available in the north west and this would suit entrepreneurial businesses looking for premises that are different and special.\"</p><p>The office space is within buildings that once housed and serviced Catalina and Sunderland flying boats, which became part of Hobsonville's air force base in WWII.</p><p>They were idle for years until Willis Bond secured the development rights over 1.8 hectares of land from Hobsonville Land Company (HLC), which was established by the government to oversee the development of the former Defence Department land at Hobsonville Point. Part of its aim is to increase the supply of medium density housing in Auckland.</p><p>HLC chief executive Chris Aiken said it was important that any development celebrated the bay's aviation and military history and retained the seaplane hangar and other key heritage buildings, in which The Hangar is located.</p><p>The Sunderland hangar also houses microbrewery Little Creatures, while other surrounding historic buildings are home to Fabric Cafe Bistro, Asian fusion eatery Siamese Doll, while the popular Catalina Bay Farmers Market has also been rehoused there.</p><p>Willis Bond has a proposed three-stage masterplan for Catalina Bay in a once under-used area of waterfront land at the north-eastern edge of Hobsonville Point. It will transform the area into a seaside village with a blend of retail, commercial, hospitality and residential developments.</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/co-working-space-ready-to-land-new-business/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Other occupiers on the site — tyre retailers Beaurepaires, plus temporary residential tenancies — are only on periodic terms, supplying holding income while the site waits for redevelopment.</p><p>“This property offers the purchaser significant potential, not only to generate income as is, but also re-development for commercial, residential, retail, medical, hotel, retirement, church, educational and many other uses.”</p><p>The property occupies a number of freehold titles totalling 4683sq m at the junction of Great South Rd and Main Highway, locally known as the Harp of Erin intersection.</p><p>Auckland City Council’s website says an average 44,753 cars pass the site every day.</p><p>The property has dual street frontage immediately south of the Z service station on Great South Rd.</p><p>It features two 1960s-era buildings, one occupied by Rod Milner Motors and the other by Beaurepaires.</p><p>Also on site is a workshop linked to a multi-level office building that fronts Main Highway.</p><p>The property also features a 1700sq m car yard that provides capacity for about 100 vehicles.</p><p>The Rod Milner component comprises a vehicle showroom, workshop, and office building. The upper levels are partially utilised as commercial office accommodation, with a residential apartment on the upper floor.</p><p>To the rear of the showrooms are two workshop areas, one used for fitting tyres and the other as a workshop.</p><p>Approached from the Main Highway, the multi-level building offers asphalt forecourt with several partially covered car parks at basement level.</p><p>Also, on the property, at 7 Main Rd, is a two storey house with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a double garage. Whalley says a notable feature of the site is that it extends through to Main Highway, offering dual street frontages and accesses.</p><p>“But it is the zoning that really tees up development potential here,” he said.</p><p>“The property is zoned Business-Mixed Use under the Auckland Unitary Plan, which provides for generous options that allow for a wide variety of end uses.</p><p>“This block of land lies within the Southern Corridor, a place where extensive development has taken place during the last decade.</p><p>“Many of the car yard sites have been upgraded to showrooms occupied by franchise car dealerships, and to the south along Great South Rd is the extensive mid-rise Millennium Centre development.</p><p>“Greenlane is known for its leafy green streets and well-established housing. In the past few years we have seen many new residential developments and apartment blocks come into the area.”</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/iconic-greenlane-re-development-site-finally-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Surrounding industrial businesses include automotive parts suppliers, tool suppliers, plumbers, tyre retailers, metal yards and transport, logistics and supply companies.

            "cleanhtml": "<font color=\"#000000\"><p>The Xero building in St George’s Bay Rd, Parnell.</p><p>The Auckland CBD fringe precincts of Grafton, Newton, College Hill, Parnell and Newmarket have lost almost a quarter of their total office accommodation over the past decade, Bayleys Research’s latest overview of Auckland’s metropolitan office markets has revealed.</p><p>Bayleys Research senior analyst Goran Ujdur says this has been the result of better uses being found for properties containing typically poorer quality and dated C and D grade office buildings.</p><p>“In the majority of cases the recycling of these sites has taken the form of high density residentially accommodation. This has resulted in a healthy regeneration of parts of central Auckland in need of rejuvenation and is in line with Auckland Council’s plan to encourage more mixed use development in metropolitan areas outside of the CBD with good public transport connections.”</p><p>As a result, Ujdur says the total area of office accommodation surveyed annually by Bayleys Research in these five main Auckland city fringe office precincts has declined from 505,000 sq m in 2009 to just over 391,000 sq m currently.</p><p>“However, this trend now appears to be showing signs of reversing with the development of better quality new office space, particularly in the high profile suburbs of Parnell and Newmarket. With office vacancy in Auckland’s CBD at an historically low level, occupier demand for commercial accommodation is increasingly spilling over into CBD fringe and suburban locations.”</p><p>Bayleys’ Auckland city &amp; fringe director Alan Haydock says larger businesses in the IT and utility sectors are at the forefront of the push into amenity rich city fringe areas. Recent examples include Xero’s centralisation of its Auckland operations to new premises in St George’s Bay Rd, Parnell and Mercury Energy’s recently completed head office building in Newmarket following on from Watercare Services relocation into another new nearby development.</p><p>He says: “This trend is expected to continue as competition to attract and retain key talent increases and organisations look more closely at locational attributes and high spec work environments as draw-cards.</p><p>“Improved transport links to Parnell, including the opening of the railway station, are attracting greater occupier interest. Equally, Newmarket’s good public transport connections and proximity to amenities such as the Domain and a major redevelopment of Westfield’s 277 shopping mall is continuing to attract tenant interest. Prime office rents in both markets have recorded further growth over the past 12 months, a trend we expect will continue into 2020.</p><p>“Longer term, Auckland Transport’s plans to significantly increase the frequency and capacity of the rail network once the City Rail loop is completed should further enhance the desirability of fringe city locations as work destinations.”</p><p>Haydock says Auckland’s largest office developer, Mansons TCLM, has undertaken a number of successful projects in Parnell, Newmarket and College Hill over the past few years and is likely to continue to remain active in these areas, as well as in the CBD.</p><p>In Parnell, the owners of 24 Balfour Rd, Parnell (Whitecliffe College of Art and Design) have engaged Ferron Hay Architects to come up with plans to convert it into upmarket office space. Callaghan Innovations which also occupies space at 24 Balfour Road will be moving to the nearby Textile Centre.</p><p>Bayleys Research’s latest city fringe office vacancy survey shows overall metropolitan office vacancies have recorded little change over the past 12 months, currently standing at 9.2 per cent compared to 9.3 per cent a year earlier. Vacancy levels ranged from 5.2 per cent in Parnell to 12.7 per cent in Grafton.</p><p>“Despite the general lack of movement in the overall vacancy rate, prime vacancies remain very tight, with little, if any, prime space of scale (more than 1,000 sq m) available for occupation,” says Ujdur. “Unoccupied space mostly comprises smaller pockets of lesser quality, older style office accommodation.”</p><p>Haydock says city fringe investment property remains in high demand, although listings are getting tighter.</p><p>“Supply shortages at the prime end of the market have resulted in investors looking more closely at B grade stock with potential for higher and better uses. Syndication operators and local private investors currently dominate investment activity although a growing amount of off-shore capital, unable to secure CBD assets, is now seriously looking at fringe city locations.</p><p>“The recent drop in the OCR, with the likelihood of further decreases, is resulting in more investors moving out of cash and back into property in search of income yield.”</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/almost-a-quarter-of-city-fringe-office-space-lost/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

However, not all requirements will likely be satisfied, according to latest research from Colliers International.</p><p>The vacancy rate is now at 5.0 per cent, representing less than 72,000sq m of office space available to lease in the Auckland CBD – the lowest level since Colliers' records began in the mid-1990s. It is also below the record low achieved in December 2018 when the vacancy rate reached 5.2 per cent.</p><p>Chris Dibble, the agency's director of research and communications, says leasing continues to be buoyant for all grades of office space, however, finding enough suitable space for tenants can be a challenge.</p><p>“It is quite remarkable how low the vacancy rate has become. The current record low means that in the past 25 years, tenants have always had more options to pursue.</p><p>“Given there really are only pockets of vacant space scattered across the city, tenant requirements are not always matchable with available space.</p><p>“This has meant tenants with the ability to remain in their current location for now, are waiting until more opportunities arise as new office developments complete and existing space is freed-up after tenants relocate.</p><p>“However, there may not be a significant number of options as many of the new developments already have sizeable pre-commitment rates or existing space is being repurposed into other uses,” Dibble says.</p><p>One of the first major office developments to complete will be Precinct Properties’ billion-dollar development – Commercial Bay. However, the 39,000sq m of office space is already over 80 per cent pre-committed, according to company records.</p><p>Precinct Properties is also developing around 8,200sq m of space at 10 Madden Street in Wynyard Quarter, with Media Design School securing 60 per cent of the premises. The space they leave behind will be converted into hotel accommodation.</p><p>While Bell Gully will be moving into newly redeveloped space at One Queen Street in 2020, around 8,000sq m of existing office space will be repositioned to make way for a new flagship hotel, InterContinental Auckland.</p><p>Many current tenants relocating from the One Queen Street redevelopment along with companies located from around the Auckland region will secure back-fill space in Precinct Properties’ premises at AMP Centre and PwC Centre at 188 Quay Street.</p><p>In Wynyard Quarter, Mansons TCLM’s development at 155 Fanshawe Street is on target to complete next year, already with 63 per cent pre-commitment. Large portions of the back-fill space are anecdotally already being negotiated.</p><p>The success of this 6-star Green Star rated building has led Mansons TCLM to start development of 136 Fanshawe Street with completion expected in 2021, providing approximately 20,000sq m of available space.</p><p>Precinct Properties, perhaps also recognising what seems to be a relatively balanced supply response given the extreme lows in current available space, is also looking to market new office space in the Innovation Precinct in Wynyard Quarter, with availability around two to three years away.</p><p>The recent purchase of Auckland Council’s 35 Graham Street by Asset Plus has already sparked discussions about the provision of new supply upon council’s lease expiry in two years. An additional two to three levels of office space (subject to resource consents) could be pursued to cater to market demand.</p><p>Dibble notes that while progress is underway and new options will gradually become available, it doesn’t leave many significant opportunities for tenants in the short-term, meaning rents will likely keep rising for now.</p><p>“Net face rents will continue to push higher over the next few years led by new-build premium rates that currently range between $575 per sq m and $795 per sq m, with varying levels of incentives to secure the best tenants on the best terms.”</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/tenants-betting-on-future-office-supply-risk-disappointment/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Much of the available studio space is already earmarked for other productions.</p><p>New Zealand’s reputation as one of the world’s most film-friendly countries is reflected in the amount of work our studios attract.</p><p>For the 2018-19 year, eight local feature films have gone into production and 20 international features, drama and factual series were committed for the same period.</p><p>“From a real estate perspective, the industry is saying it’s almost at a point where it risks becoming a victim of its own success,” said Johnson.</p><p>“Even with a new studio opening a year ago on 27ha of former industrial land at Kumeu, Auckland is short of space for studio facilities. And Wellington also needs space.”</p><p>Auckland's two biggest studios — Auckland Film Studios (AFS), on a 10.5ha Henderson site, and Kumeu Film Studios (KFS) — occupy 37.5ha between them.</p><p>They are leased and operated by ATEED, the council-controlled economic development agency, from another council organization, Panuku, which has the assets in its property portfolio.</p><p>AFS has been a mainstay of Auckland’s screen production for 25 years. It occupies former cool stores bought by Waitakere City Council in 2002 for $3.8m.</p><p>AFS has three sound stages, the largest occupying 1924sq m, plus nine associated buildings and a back lot.</p><p>“The quality of the main sound stage means the studios remain in strong demand, with major international productions in place throughout last year, two international TV series in production now, and bookings until the middle of 2022,” says Pam Ford, ATEED's economic development general manager.</p><p>AFS is also a base for filming James Cameron's Avatar 2 and 3 sequels. This multi-year project is being shared with Wellington's Stone Street Studios.</p><p>ATEED has a five-year lease running until October 2022. If filming is ongoing the lease will be extended, says Ford.</p><p>The agency’s lease over KFS runs until 2029, while development on that site in collaboration with the Korean family owner has been ongoing.</p><p>KFS features two 2300sq m sound stages; an indoor dive tank; an outdoor ocean horizon tank, with an 864sq m green screen wall; 4000sq m of stage area; 6000sq m of workshop space and production offices; plus a forest, stream and yard which form sought-after back lots.</p><p>KFS took shape on former timber processing land under a partnership between Warner Bros and China's Gravity Pictures, the New Zealand Film Commission, the private land owner and ATEED.</p><p>Auckland’s smaller studios include South Pacific Pictures, in Henderson, Studio West, in Glen Eden, Kelly Park Film Studios, near Silverdale, and central Auckland’s Beop Studios. AR/VR Garage is home to augmented and virtual reality start-ups.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wellington has become a film production and screen technology hotspot, with resulting growth in the industry’s property footprint.</p><p>Director Sir Peter Jackson, special-effects guru Sir Richard Taylor and editor and producer Jamie Selkirk have created a highly successful empire with Stone Street Studios, Weta Digital, Weta Workshop, Park Road Post and equipment rental firm Portsmouth.</p><p>The multi-million dollar studios, sound stages and pre- and post-production facilities are based on an 8ha site in Miramar.</p><p>The complex has four purpose-built stages, including the world-class 2238sq m ‘Kong’ sound-proofed stage. There is a further 6670sq m across three other studios, 6177sq m of workshop, 1795sq m of offices, plus a large back lot.</p><p>Wellington's other main studio, Avalon, has five stages covering 1462sq m on a 2.45ha site in Lower Hutt, with a back lot, production offices and helicopter pad. <br/>It was the early centre of television-broadcasting production.</p><p>It also became the focus of film production, building on the National Film Unit, which Jackson bought in the late 1990s and incorporated into Park Road Post. In April 2012 a consortium, Avalon Holdings, bought the Avalon Studios.</p><p>With a big stream of work over the past five years, film has become a big contributor to national GDP, hitting $2.2b in the year to June 2018. That was a drop from a stellar 2017 when revenue hit $3b, with fewer big-budget films and a decline in television activity.</p><p>A rebound is expected this year with demand still coming from major US-based studios, plus countries such as China, and streaming.</p><p>ATEED and the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency both say they are exploring further development, and have pointed to a need for more studio space.</p><p>ATEED’s Ford says streaming companies are driving an increase in studio inquiries around the world, and Auckland has already hosted a number of productions for companies such as Netflix.</p><p>“Streaming companies have a different business model combining content creation with distribution, so the ability to create content is crucial,” Ford said.</p><p>“They often need studio space which is entirely their own — representing an evolution from the traditional film studio model which has different players alongside each other within the same facility.” </p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/casting-call-for-commercial-space/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

It is accessed from a path running along the face of the seawall below the level of the main footpath.</div><div></div><div>The character shed faces out to Evans Bay and the Miramar Peninsula to the east. There are residential properties directly across the road on Evans Bay Parade.</div><div></div><div>At just 56.16 square metres (including jetty), the boatshed punches above its weight as these structures go, boasting a fully-consented toilet, shower and kitchenette with hot water cylinder, while interior walls and floors are original.</div><div></div><div>Ethan Hourigan of Bayleys Wellington says tenure is by way of licence to occupy via a coastal permit issued by Greater Wellington Regional Council, with usage, occupation and development governed by rules within the Regional Coastal Plan. The property features in Bayleys’ latest Total Property portfolio magazine.  </div><div></div><div>“Under these rules, residential occupation is not permitted with our understanding being that the preferred usage is for water-related activity,” he says.</div><div></div><div>“The boatsheds can be repaired and maintained, but must not be physically extended or altered externally without first obtaining Council consent and building permits.”</div><div></div><div>While the existing coastal permit for this boatshed expires in September 2020, the vendor understands that once renewed, it is likely to be valid beyond 2030.</div><div></div><div>“This permit is currently in the process of being renewed and the licence to occupy is transferable to a new owner,” explains Hourigan.</div><div></div><div>It is rare for boatsheds to come to the open market in the Wellington region and for this reason, value will be determined in the auction room on Thursday 5th December.</div><div></div><div>Hourigan says the 15 boatsheds were originally built for the storage and maintenance of small boats and associated boating gear, and they largely remain used for this purpose today.</div><div></div><div>“However, some lateral thinking has seen some owners in recent years optimising the location and uniqueness of the sheds and creating innovative work spaces and ‘man/woman caves’.”</div><div></div><div>Wellington lays claim to several clusters of coastal boatsheds with those at Onepoto, Titahi Bay, Paremata and Camborne contributing to a distinctive heritage asset for the region.</div><div></div><div>The Evans Bay boatsheds have historic significance for their longevity and largely-original exteriors and are socially-significant for the role they have played in Wellington’s boating community.</div><div></div><div>“Wellington Harbour is renowned for the opportunities it presents for sailing and fishing and many of the boatshed owners today are active in these areas,” says Hourigan.</div><div></div><div>“The sheds are perfect for storing small boats, optimist yachts, kayaks and stand-up paddle boards, and will appeal to people who would like a base for their water pursuits without needing to</div><div>rent a lock-up or storage unit in an industrial area.</div><div></div><div>“Equally, some owners are combining their love of the water with an office work space and there are some great examples of these multi-purpose sheds along the Parade.”</div><div></div><div>Evans Bay Parade, which stretches 4.3 kilometres from Oriental Parade to Rongotai Road, is one of the longest roads in Wellington and historically, was the focal point for boating and other sea-orientated activity.</div><div></div><div>It was home to the training base for the Wellington Navals' Association in 1896 and 1897 and in 1918, Evans Bay Yacht and Motor Boat Club was founded with its clubhouse used as the customs and immigration point for flying boats from the late-1940s until the mid-1950s.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/historic-wellington-waterfront-property-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

He says his clients are now looking to release capital from their property portfolio.</p><p>The property is being marketed in conjunction with Sam MacDonald of Bayleys Napier.</p><p><br/>A re-negotiated 15-year lease is in place with established tenants Antares Restaurant Group Limited, the company that operates the Burger King NZ licence.</p><p>As with much of the surrounding retail environment, the 2964sq m site, at 190 Station St, is Crown leasehold land.</p><p>The 59sq m single-storey building sits on a fully sealed and landscaped site with 43 car parks and a vehicle drive-through facility.</p><p>Smith says the building was built in 1994 — coincidentally around the time that Burger King started trading in New Zealand — for the former fast food chain Georgie Pie and converted to a Burger King restaurant in 2003.</p><p>“Now into its 16th year of trading from the site, Antares Group committed to a further 15-year lease with two, five-year rights of renewal beyond that,” he says.</p><p>“It’s a full net lease with the tenant paying all outgoings on the building. Clearly, this location has worked well for their business which is just a two-minute walk to Reading Cinema and within Napier’s bulk retail hub, where key national tenants include Pak'nSave, Countdown, Z Energy, KFC, McDonalds, Jetts Fitness, Warehouse Stationery and Harvey Norman.”</p><p>The property returns a net income of $97,800 + GST, after ground lease commitments to the Crown are met.</p><p>MacDonald says the concept of leasehold land is familiar to those investing in Napier. “It’s accepted that prime commercial locations in this part of Napier are generally subject to ground leases,” he said.</p><p>“The presence of major national tenants with significant bulk retail functions in the immediate vicinity shows that it’s a proven commercial part of the city and investors have taken on the leasehold commitments with some confidence.”</p><p>The building comprises a reinforced concrete floor slab and foundations with concrete columns and steel portal frames. Wall cladding features textured cement finish to the rear part of the building with the balance featuring extensive use of aluminium-framed glazing. The roof is curved galvanised steel with pedestrian and drive-through canopies attached to the main structure.</p><p>“The internal fit-out is typical for Burger King with seating capacity for about 200 people,” says Smith. “The building has recently been re-imaged to bring it up to speed with the current Burger King look and feel, which adds to the street appeal and the dine-in surrounds.”</p><p>The latest Restaurant Association Hospitality Report (September 2018) finds that nationwide sales for the hospitality industry have continued to grow, with fast food/takeaway food recording the highest growth.</p><p>The takeaway/food sector is recording the highest growth, up 5.7 per cent, year-on-year, in 2018. In dollar terms, this translates to an increase in annual sales of $148m. The property, at 190 Station St, Napier, will be auctioned at Bayleys Wellington on August 8.</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/fast-food-property-a-tasty-opportunity-1/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

There are numerous options for development including the existing four titles, a farm park, eco-tourism and extending the vineyard.</p><p>The property is being marketed by tender through Bayleys Hastings salespeople Tim Wynne-Lewis and Kris August, with tenders closing on August 7.</p><p>“Although the five-year resource consent for the four titles of about 10ha each runs out in August next year, a new buyer could apply to the Hastings District Council for this to be extended,” Wynne-Lewis said.</p><p>“A main house and secondary residence are allowed on each of the titles. <br/>Alternatively a new owner could apply for a farm park subdivision as the land is on the cusp of being at the size required by the district council and this could allow for more building sites.”</p><p>Another option, he said, would be to establish an eco-tourism business with lodges on the elevated parts the farm. There are already wineries and other corporate ventures in the area and the property has a number of elevated potential building sites with different aspects and expansive views in all directions and rocky limestone outcrops, adding to the aesthetic appeal.</p><p>Other features include a variety of established trees and shrubs and a frame for further development. Access to the farm is by 4x4 tracks. Wynne-Lewis said work has been done on planning a new access road.</p><p>As most of the property has been used for grazing, there are cattle yards and a loading race, and a bore close to the state highway boundary. Water is pumped to an elevated concrete tank and gravity-fed to troughs in paddocks. The bore also pumps water to an irrigation control station above the vineyard terraces.</p><p>“The property's elevation and views gives it the appeal factor for a new owner, plus the resource consents already in place and the nearly 6ha vineyard with syrah, merlot and chardonnay grapes. Consent is in place to irrigate 15ha of vineyard.”</p><p>A two-bay implement, shed with a concrete floor, roller doors, a side entry door, a staff kitchen and facilities is beneath the vineyard terraces on the northern boundary of the property.</p><p>An inter-family lease on a year-to-year basis has been established, which takes care of the management of the vineyard and grazing on the rest of the land.</p><p>The area is well known for grape growing — labels Trinity Hill and Te Awa Estate are next door. The renowned Bridge Pa triangle is close by and the many wineries are linked by cycle trails.</p><p>Hastings and Havelock North are a 15-minute drive away, and Napier is about 25 minutes.

Rent reviews every three years to market and to CPI every two years are written into the lease.</p><p>Swanson said the property is expected to be snapped up. “It is a new, premium-grade building, in an area of high growth, with two blue chip tenants providing a good passive income — property fundamentals every investor strives to add to their portfolios.</p><p>Swanson’s colleague ten Hove said the property parallels the strength of the tenants' profile, anchored by the Waikato economy.</p><p>“Extensive naming rights signage on the building ensures it is one of the most instantly recognised properties in the Te Rapa precinct,” he said.</p><p>Te Rapa's low vacancy rates in the industrial zone are expected to continue. “The pace of growth is driving a wave of new development and rents for better quality properties are expected to show further improvement,” ten Hove said.</p><p>“The golden triangle of Auckland, Hamilton, and Tauranga produces a staggering 50 per cent of New Zealand's GDP, along with more than 70 per cent of the country's industrial and commercial development consents,” said Swanson.</p><p>Lead tenant Burnsco has 15 stores from the Bay of Islands to Christchurch.

            "cleanhtml": "<font color=\"#000000\"><p>An artist's impression for the development at 252-258 Great North Road.</p><p>Three high-profile central Auckland sites with plans for prestige residential and commercial developments have been placed on the market for sale by Barfoot and Thompson.</p><p><br/>The properties, located in the central city fringe suburbs of Grey Lynn, Grafton and Ponsonby, offer buyers the chance to purchase sites with resource consented development proposals already in place.</p><p><br/>One of the properties - 1A Burton Street - has resource consent for high-rise residential developments, while the other two, on the corner of Pollen Street and Vinegar Lane &amp; 252-258 Great North Road, have resource consent for high-rise residential developments with a ground-floor commercial component.<br/>All three are included in the Barfootand Thompson Commercial Insite portfolio and are being marketed for individual sale by negotiation by Barfoot and Thompson agents Marty Roestenburg and Reese Barragar.</p><p>Roestenburg says: “These properties would be ideal projects for developers seeking to capitalise on Auckland's need for high-quality residential accommodation and the Unitary Plan’s push for higher-density development around key suburban commercial hubs.</p><p>“All are located in extremely popular central fringe suburbs, and are well served by retail and hospitality businesses. There is a strong demand for premium entry-point accommodation in these suburbs, which together with the increasing shift towards apartment living, make them solid development opportunities for experienced hands.”</p><p>On offer at 29 Pollen Street, Ponsonby, is a 424sq m fee simple site with resource and building consents for a five-level development comprising 11 apartments and one commercial unit on the ground floor. The apartment units are a mixture of two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments, and the building area is around 1,672sq m.<br/>Roestenburg says: “The plans are well advanced on this, the vendor has done the numbers on the development and the reserve contribution has already been paid. So that takes away some of the question marks, and gives us more full stops.”</p><p>The site on offer is currently a gravel carpark, “so there’s no demolition needed - buyers can start work immediately”.</p><p>Roestenburg adds that the vendor has purchased 5 car parks and leased 10 car parks from the neighbouring supermarket, to ensure almost adequate parking, increasingly rare in the neighbourhood. </p><p>Architects FORMiS have delivered upscale designs for the apartments, in keeping with the style of the rest of the Vinegar Lane precinct. Similar ground floor commercial units in the area have been used for hospitality or office space.</p><p>Roestenburg says the 1,002sq m fee simple site on offer at 252-258 Great North Road, Grey Lynn, has resource consent for a six-level development comprising 37 apartments, ranging from studios to three-beds, and 39 on-site car parks. The building area is around 5,500sq m.</p><p>Roestenburg says there are also draft plans to convert the development into a hotel and / or short-term accommodation, and vendor has already undertaken the preliminary work for the design change.</p><p>“There are apartment projects going up along this strip, there’s big demand on the fringe here. The fact that there’s a Bunnings down the road, and a Bentley and</p><p>Tesla dealer on the other shows you the sort of transformation the area is going through,” he says. </p><p>The 251sq m fee simple site at 1A Burton Street, Grafton, has resource consent for a six-level development comprising 40 apartment units. The land is triangular in shape, with street frontage on one side, and the building area is 1,456sq m.</p><p>Pockets of land in Grafton - which is the centre of university and hospital life in the city - rarely come to market, says Roestenburg. </p><p>The accommodation is designed as smaller, short stay units for students or hospital staff, with a bike room rather than carparking.</p><p>“It’s a small corner of land, but it shows what density you can get under the unitary plan. It is meeting the big demand for accommodation here,” he says.</p><p>Also on offer in the Commercial Insite portfolio is a three level mixed-use building in Auckland CBD. The property at 222 Hobson St is being sold with vacant possession or with a lease back to vendor.</p><p>It is being marketed for sale by tender, closing at 2pm, August 15, by Barfoot and Thompson sales agents Rex Fowler and Wayne Muir.</p><p>Fowler says: “The freehold site near Sky City and the soon to be completed International Convention Centre offers potential buyers an opportunity to invest, occupy or substantially develop.</p><p>“The building is currently owner-occupied. The ground floor is home to a high-end art gallery and cafe with a modern fit-out. Above it is a resource consented apartment, with a large living area, open plan kitchen and four bedrooms.”</p><p>Fowler says the basement level offers “ample” storage areas and car parking and is accessed via a ramp off Hobson Street.</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/ready-to-go-developments/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The shops are ‘On the Spot’ stores, part of the Foodstuffs group, which is a high-quality offering covering the Pams and Budget ranges.”</p><p>The location of the two sites is top tier, too, Ingrosso says.</p><p>Both sites are on busy thoroughfares and service strong residential areas.</p><p>Bishopdale is directly across from the mall where there is a New World supermarket and several hospitality outlets, and Kaiapoi is just past the main centre of the town towards Sovereign Palms.</p><p>The Kaiapoi site has had recent redevelopment and is one of the newest sites to the network.</p><p>“It was completely rebuilt from the ground up in 2010 and was one of the early openings post-earthquake.</p><p>“The Bishopdale service station has a fascinating history. Operating as a service station since 1962, the site has only been through three different owners in its time and has been with the vendor’s family for the past 27 years.”</p><p>The site has had improvements made as recently as 2017 which means it has the latest systems installed.</p><p>“Getting down to business, turnover at Kaiapoi for the Financial Year 2019 was over $12m with total shop sales of more than $30,000 a week.</p><p>“Bishopdale had a total turnover of over $10m with the shop also performing handsomely.</p><p>“The return offered by each business is over 20 per cent based on the asking prices, which, considering they have existing management in place, is a desirable opportunity.”</p><p>Ingrosso says these businesses are ideal for someone looking to live an exciting lifestyle and be part of a dynamic industry.</p><p>“I have sold a number of these businesses recently and there is a trend in the South Island that the next generation of motivated owner operators are taking over these businesses. “It’s great to see as it’s how the Caltex model should operate and it’s good to see the businesses stay locally-owned by members of the community they service.”</p><p>For those who are new to the industry, Caltex operates as part of the Z Energy network though somewhat differently to the Z model as the Caltex sites are all independently-owned and operated by local business owners.<br/> <br/>And, being in Christchurch means anyone living close by or moving there is a stone’s throw away from an array of outdoor activities and an enviable lifestyle, Ingrosso says.</p><p>Home to parks, reserves, beaches and a huge selection of dining options, Christchurch is a great place to work and play.</p><p>The commitment to transform the city into a 21st Century city means the local economy is being supported by a $40 billion investment which will drive decades of development.</p><p>This makes the energetic and resilient Canterbury region number one for growth in New Zealand.</p><p>The region is also one of New Zealand’s best-known and most highly developed business markets.</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/service-stations-are-fuel-for-savvy-investors/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

It is being marketed by Bayleys Ngatea salespeople Josh Smith and Daniel Keane for sale by auction on August 29.</p><p><br/>“The hotel has a central role in the township as the only licensed, seven-day establishment,” Smith said.</p><p><br/>“It is ripe for redevelopment, with the lease ending in 2026, and numerous options for housing and retail operations.”</p><p><br/> The hotel has a public bar with Sky Sport and TAB facilities, a lounge for live bands and other events, as well as an outdoor garden bar.</p><p><br/>There is a separate gaming area with 15 pokie machines. Adjoining the bar is a bottle store.</p><p><br/>In addition to the main building, and joined by a covered walkway, is the restaurant and accommodation wing, with a three-bedroom manager's residence. The hotel is leased until January 2026 with no further rights of renewal. It returns $90,000 a year with rent reviews to market in January 2021, 2023, and 2025. “This allows a new owner to to extend the tenancy or explore the potential of the site,” Smith said.</p><p><br/>“There are numerous options for redevelopment of the hotel site, particularly as commercial infrastructure is in short supply.</p><p><br/>“About 2000sq m of the property can be accessed at the rear from Dent St and could be suitable for housing. The remaining land would be ideal for retail development.”</p><p><br/>Ngatea's population is growing. “Its rural lifestyle is becoming popular for commuters with jobs in both Hamilton and Auckland,” Smith said.</p><p><br/> Ngatea's Hauraki Plains College has 780 pupils and is one of the top academic state schools in the country. It is expecting to enrol more pupils over the next couple of years.</p><p><br/>“There are numerous options for redevelopment of the hotel site, particularly as commercial infrastructure is in short supply,” Mr Smith said.<br/>“About 2000sq m square metres of the property can be accessed at the rear from Dent Street and could be suitable for housing development.<br/> Mr Smith said.</p><p><br/>“The remaining land would be ideal for a multi-unit retail development in the heart of the thriving town.</p><p><br/>“A new owner could also extend the lease while he scoping out the best and highest use for the property, which has the biggest profile in the town and is for sale for the first time in a quarter of a century.”</p><p><br/>Ngatea's first shop opened in 1911, operated by a Kerepehi resident who travelled each day by river, then the main outlet for settlers. It supplied most of the day-to-day needs of the local people, much as the hotel serves as the most frequent meeting place for locals today, Mr Smith said.</p><p><br/>Ngatea developed as a main trading centre for the plains and the residential area steadily expanded with other villages' populations remaining static, but declining in many others.</p><p><br/>Change is still taking place, with an increasing number of retired people now living in Ngatea, commuters finding the rural lifestyle appealing and the town's dual role serving the surrounding farming community and visitors through the hotel, a motel, veterinary services, hardware shops, garages and workshops, service stations, cafes, dairies and convenience food outlets, good for business.</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/field-of-dreams-in-hauraki-plains-a-pub-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The company is ranked 15th in the CA ANZ top 30 accounting firms in New Zealand.</div><div></div><div>The well-presented Whitaker Street property was constructed as a purpose-built office complex in the 1980s of brick, aluminium joinery and an iron cladding roof.

The rural sector provided the foundation for the company's growth and continues to have a special place in its business.</div><div></div><div>Described as a progressive chartered accountancy, Diprose Miller helps clients embrace technology to drive growth. It was named Xero’s national accounting firm of the year in 2017.</div><div></div><div>Mr Smith said Te Aroha is experiencing some growth.

The bulk of Queenstown’s commercial accommodation providers are in the four and five-star categories.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The Accommodation Survey report noted: “New Zealand’s tourism sector has boomed over recent years as overseas visitor numbers have increased sharply. Queenstown with its international reputation as an adventure tourism centre has been one of the major beneficiaries of increased spending.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Tourism Industry Association figures show that across both categories of four and</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>five-star rated properties in Queenstown, annual occupancy rates for the year to April 30, 2019, sat at 81.3 per cent – substantially up from the 65.6 per cent benchmark recorded in 2010. The association reported that in the peak summer months of January and February, hotel occupancy rates sat at around 93 per cent.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Concurrently, the association’s data also showed that average nightly room rates for hotels in the region rose from $155 in the year ending March 31, 2015, to $249 for the year ending March 31, 2019.

The listing features in Bayleys’ latest Total Property portfolio magazine.</div><div></div><div>“The site would be suited to industrial subdivision into multiple lots with their own titles or the creation of a hub comprising multiple tenancies. Resource consent would be needed from the Matamata Piako District Council for subdivision,” Mr Smith said.</div><div></div><div>“A new owner could alternatively land bank the property for future use or investment. It could also be left as a lifestyle block with a new owner using the land for grazing.”</div><div></div><div>A three-bedroom family house is included in the sale, which Mr Smith said could be used as a holding income while plans are developed for the site or it could potentially be re purposed into a site office or left as a home for a farm lifestyle.</div><div></div><div>From the industrial development perspective, Mr Smith said Morrinsville was recognised as a cost-effective option for companies looking for prime cheaper land close to Hamilton.</div><div></div><div>“There has been recent development of industrial sites, while sales of land have proven the demand for industrial titles supporting future development,” he said.</div><div></div><div>“Morrinsville's proximity to Hamilton 29 kilometres away has seen businesses regard the town as a feasible option as other comparable sites in the bigger areas are priced out of the market.”</div><div></div><div>Morrinsville is a town supported by a strong rural economy and recognised as an extension of Hamilton.</div><div></div><div>“It is regarded as one of the most intensively dairy farmed areas in the world creating a large service industry, although there are other businesses setting up in the town”</div><div></div><div>The town's population of just over 7,000 is expected to increase to 8,800 people living in 3,768 homes by 2033. That would mean more business and industrial land would be needed, said Mr Smith. A total of 37 hectares of vacant industrial zoned land is located within or on the outskirts of the town. Thirteen hectares will be needed by 2033, according to the Matamata Piako District Council's 30-year town strategy.</div><div></div><div>However, if most of the demand is for land in town, then the supply will start to run out by 2033, Mr Smith said.</div><div></div><div>Much of the land located in the western part of Morrinsville’s Business Zone is more industrial than commercial in nature. The stockyards and grain silos are a legacy of the historic development of Morrinsville, while more recent service industry businesses have been established under the operative district plan provisions that permit light industry in both the business and industrial zones.</div><div></div><div>Mr Smith said other industrial businesses have established sites south of the town, in two adjacent areas. The first area, along Morrinsville Walton Road, comprises heavy industries such as fertiliser and chemical manufacturing. The second area, along Bolton Road, includes conventional industries such as a transport depot, concrete manufacturing plant, and other light industries.</div><div></div><div>The town strategy shows an inner industrial area, adjacent to existing commercial development, on land already zoned Industrial and further development within the outer industrial area located south of Morrinsville also on land already zoned Industrial.</div><div></div><div>Mr Smith said the inner industrial area will appeal to service industries, dependent on a central location for customer contact.  The outer industrial area will have land available to locate new heavy industry as well as light industries that are less dependent on passing trade or customer contact.</div><div></div><div>“Freight movements are likely to be predominantly from and to the west, in the direction of Hamilton. This will minimise the need for heavy vehicles to travel through the town to access the area,” he said.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/large-industrial-land-holding-for-sale-as-businesses-seek-cheaper-sites/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

It’s also near Tainui Group Holdings 500ha inland port which is under development.”</span></p><p class=\"x_Textbody\"><span>Ten Hove says Te Rapa Gateway is Hamilton's fastest growing industrial area and its zoning provides for a diverse range of warehousing, bulk storage, processing and manufacturing.</span></p><p class=\"x_Textbody\"><span>“Companies which have set up at the industrial park include Christchurch machinery and tool supplier TopmaQ, and O'Brien Plumbing and Bathroomware – both new businesses to Hamilton.</span></p><p class=\"x_Textbody\"><span>“Several large businesses are now housed at Te Rapa Gateway and include Bidvest, Lely, Normans Transport, Southpac Trucks, roofing manufacturer Metalcraft Industries, packaging company Attwood, Hynds Pipes and Viridian Glass.</span></p><p class=\"x_Textbody\"><span>“Growth has been driven by economic confidence in the Waikato, low interest rates and industrial land prices which are half of those for key Auckland industrial areas and also quite a bit cheaper than Tauranga land.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>“Vacancy rates for industrial property are low and builders are struggling to keep up with the demand for new developments.

            "cleanhtml": "<font color=\"#000000\"><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>A large Northland block of fertile land and buildings, that were designed to serve as a newly built ‘Kumara World’ styled centre that would educate school children and inform tourists about New Zealand’s kumara industry, will go under the hammer at the end of this month.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The complex, with accommodation facilities, is ideal for a variety of tourism, industrial, educational, community or religious uses, says Catherine Stewart of Bayleys Dargaville who is marketing 39 Maxwell Rd, Dargaville for sale by auction commencing 1pm on Wednesday July 31.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Located 8km south of the Northland township Dargaville - in an area producing 75 per cent of New Zealand’s kumara crop - the centre has been built by local couple Warren and Mavis Suckling – who have grown kumaras in the North Kaipara region for several decades.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The couple have for many years operated The Kumara Box, a tourist attraction located 7km southwest of Dargaville. Warren Suckling, who doubles as Ernie the Kumara King, entertains tourists within a drying shed on the family’s 36ha at Pouto Rd kumara farm that has been converted into a 75-seat theatre. A projector screens The Kumara Story, a DVD the Sucklings have made that depicts ‘Ernie’ growing kumara. Tourists can then view a display of historical kumara industry memorabilia before being taken on a tour of the working kumara farm. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Warren and Mavis are incredibly passionate about growing kumara,” Stewart says. “It was their dream to build this additional venue and facility that would attract the likes of school students and tourists to visit Dargaville to learn more about the cultivation and use of kumara.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The centre for sale was the result of that vision, but has never been used. It has taken so much out of them over the years in getting to this stage. Now they are ready to retire and hand over the reins to another entrepreneur to take the complex to the next level.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span><img alt=\"True Commercial - 39 Maxwell Rd, Dargaville - dormitory bunk room - reduced.jpg\" rel=\"40300\" src=\"/media/97861/true-commercial-39-maxwell-rd-dargaville-dormitory-bunk-room-reduced.jpg?width=500&amp;height=333.3333333333333\"/></span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The main complex includes:</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Stewart says the complex’s buildings have been constructed in a horse-shoe configuration – surrounding a tennis court that can be floodlit for night games – while the two accommodation wings, ablution blocks, and kitchen/dining hall are all linked by a network of covered walkways.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>She says the venue has consent for parking two buses on the concreted driveway, which is attractively planted with palms, and there is additional parking space for up to 15 vehicles on an adjoining metalled yard. Both areas can be illuminated at night by spotlight towers – with electricity lines linked to the property’s own transformer.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The complex is fitted with sensor lights enabling guests or workers to easily negotiate their way around at night.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The buildings are fitted out with fire alarms complemented by a fire hydrant. Water is supplied via six water tanks and heated by gas.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Water for the showers, bathroom and kitchen amenities is collected off the building roofs and reticulated in a quartet of 30,000 litre plastic tanks located on the property’s boundary. Two additional separate 30,000 litre water storage tanks have also been installed at the site for exclusive use by the fire service – with a fire hose connection installed.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Sewage is fed into an underground 30,000 septic tank and concrete pumping chamber, while wastewater is pumped along a pipe network to irrigate a landscaped garden area.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span><img alt=\"True Commercial - 39 Maxwell Rd, Dargaville - auditorium - reduced.jpg\" rel=\"40299\" src=\"/media/97860/true-commercial-39-maxwell-rd-dargaville-auditorium-reduced.jpg?width=500&amp;height=333.3333333333333\"/></span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>A specifically designed and engineered septic system, which is ‘Eco-environmental’ to the latest standards, is enhanced by plantings of various colourful cannon plants.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Also on the property is a separate two bedroom, one bathroom cottage, which could be used as manager's accommodation.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“While the property was created to be a kumara education facility, it could just as easily operate as a seasonal workplace accommodation venue,” Stewart says. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Every season over March and April scores of migrant workers come into the Dargaville and Northern Kaipara area from the Pacific Islands – with the region’s backpackers’ and shearer’ quarters used to house them,” she says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Being in the heart of ‘kumara country’ it is perfectly fitted out to accommodate a casual labour force – with the two separate dormitories’ and bathroom blocks allowing for the appropriate segregation of male and female workers.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“It could also accommodate a similar workforce under the Government’s One Billion Trees Programme with seedling planting taking place over the autumn and winter months.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Stewart cites figures from the economic data-analysis agency Infometrics showing that the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector contributed 9.1 per cent of Dargaville’s gross domestic product in the year ending March 31, 2018, with the construction sector close behind, contributing 8.6 per cent of Dargaville’s gross domestic product.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The same Infometrics report revealed that total employment in Dargaville was up 8.2 per cent in the year to March 31, 2018 – compared to the national increase of 3 per cent of the same period. Over a 10-year period, employment in Dargaville grew by an average of 2.5 per cent annually – compared to 1.3 per cent for the whole of New Zealand.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Those workers employed in the rural parts of the province need somewhere to stay, so a new owner of the Maxwell Road complex could easily establish the venue as a short term accommodation provider,” Stewart says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“It has also been suggested the site could operate as a place of worship, or a self-sustaining lifestyle commune. The land portion of the location includes a substantial paddock of kumara planted in the nutrient-rich alluvial Kaipara flat soil - yielding healthy crops of red and beauregard varieties of sweet potatoes every autumn.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The flat land has been tile-drained with its rich soils easily able to sustain a small market gardening business or alternative vegetable crops; while other parts of the property could be developed to sustain a small number of farm animals or livestock capable of feeding a small community or congregation.”</span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/dargaville-s-planned-kumara-world-centre/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Access is through a single roller door.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Described as a “passive industrial investment with punch”, the freehold property is being marketed by Bayleys North Shore salespeople Laurie Burt and Matt Mimmack by private treaty, closing at 4pm on July 18. The property features in Bayleys latest <em>Total Property</em> portfolio magazine.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“This is a prime road-front industrial property in a desirable business park,” says Burt. “With a new lease generating yearly rent of $197,000 plus GST from the tenant, who has occupied the building since 2004, this is a clean and passive purchase.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Development in the surrounding Albany Heights industrial area is predominantly quality offices, retail and office/warehouse properties, the majority of which were built in the mid-2000s.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Interplex business park sprung into life on a 47ha site in 2001. At the time the market was flat and the location was seen as secondary, but the four-and-a-half year project set a point of reference for business park subdivision on the North Shore.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Interplex adopted a comprehensive suite of land use controls to ensure a high quality product, as well as an encumbrance package managed by an owners' association, controlling architecture, site planning, building form, signage and landscaping.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>From a development perspective, this was seen as critical to the success of the project, and demand for sites was reflected in land sale values that started at $179sq m  for the first sale, to $650sq m in the final stage. The business park land commanded a premium of at least 40 per cent over identical neighbouring land.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The 14 Canaveral Dr property, which was built by the Kea Property company, presents well, says Burt, and has Auckland Council</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>General Business zoning.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>This allows for businesses from light industrial to limited office, large format retail, and trade suppliers.

Canaveral Dr is off Triton Dr, which accesses Rosedale Rd and Arrenway Dr. There are good connections to the Northern Motorway by the Greville Rd or Constellation Dr interchanges. The area benefits from its closeness to the Wairau Valley, urban areas and motorways.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Strong demand from investors and tenants has developed over the past couple of years because of expansion of surrounding urban areas, completion of new developments and the area's closeness to the Albany sub-regional centre,” Burt says.</span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/north-shore-interplex-park-building/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

It’s an excellent location in a high-growth area, with a modernised, well-presented building and the security of two separate income streams from reputable tenants.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The 500sq m ground floor is leased to Sopersmac, a New Zealand-owned architectural hardware supplier which was formed via the merging of two longstanding and successful family businesses. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Sopersmac, which has over 70 staff nationwide, operates a showroom at the New North Road property, and also has office and warehouse space on the ground floor. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The first floor tenant is Potter Building Services, a mechanical and electrical services company which was established in 1983. The company, which specialises in commercial and industrial control systems and software solutions, moved in to the property in November 2018 from smaller premises in nearby Grafton.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Conrad Traill, who negotiated the lease to Potter Building Services, says the company has settled in well to the property, which is in an ideal location close to its major customers and also facilitates further business growth.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Potter has gone from 200 square metres to 500 square metres, which gives them the ability to grow and the space was also flexible enough for the company to configure their premises to suit. The first floor space now features offices along the sunny New North Road frontage, with a separate space for computer technicians and also a workshop.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Both leases have rights of renewal providing potential final expiry dates of 2031 (Sopersmac) and 2027 (Potter Building Services), with regular rental reviews built in.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The convenient city fringe location and ample car parks are beneficial to both tenants, Davies says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The property has 18 car parks, split between a semi-basement covered secure car park and further external car parking. To have this number of car parks provided in a central Auckland location right on the edge of the CBD is a big plus for the tenants.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The property is owned by the Jubilee Crippled Children Foundation Trust Board, which has owned the property for the past 14 years, says Davies.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“As an investment, the property has served the trust very well as a consistent source of income, which it has distributed for charitable purposes in line with its purpose. With the trust now divesting the property, this opens up a fantastic opportunity for a new owner to secure a strong-performing investment holding on the Auckland city fringe.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Ingham says the demand for city-fringe property among investors and tenants in Auckland remains very strong.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“There is no shortage of tenant demand for commercial space in good locations near the CBD. A central location cuts transport costs and time for companies which service the CBD, and can also help businesses attract and retain staff as there are plenty of retail and food &amp; beverage amenities nearby.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The site's location just 300m from the upcoming City Rail Link Mt Eden station is also expected to be a strong drawcard for buyers, says Traill.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“This is an area which is set to change fundamentally, with a major piece of transport infrastructure being constructed just a few minutes’ walk down the road. Increases to both land values and rents are widely expected as a result of the rail link, which is another reason there is such high demand for property in this area among investors.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The 1191sq m building, which was originally constructed in 1962, has been extensively refurbished and provides well presented, modern interiors.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>It sits on a 718sq m site on the corner of New North Road and Flower Street, in a mixed commercial location providing offices, retail and cafés. Many of the neighbouring properties are owned by Mediaworks, which is one of the largest corporate occupiers in the area.</span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/split-risk-eden-terrace-property/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The consulting rooms have recently been used as offices, but they could easily be turned back into medical premises again.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>They could also be converted for other activities, such as serving as an administration headquarters for one Huntly’s many sports team or clubs.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“It could be kept as it is, expanded to house a range of medical professionals; or the building could be demolished and the site redeveloped,” Smith says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>He says the property is being marketed as a proposed medical facility for doctors, physiotherapists, midwives and another medical-related practice such as a radiographer's suite -  with the town’s only other x-ray day unit in town located at Huntly's birthing unit.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>In particular, Smith says, the town's strong sporting history in rugby league, opens up the chance for a physiotherapist to establish a thriving business.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“There are several league clubs in the area and a number of famous international players began their careers in Huntly.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“It would suit an owner-occupier coming north from Hamilton or south from Auckland to set up a clinic in a central rural town where the population of 7000 is expanding; or a buyer with a tenant who could maximise income from the property.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“With access from both the front, where  there is a single car park, and fully fenced rear of the property, it is an opportunity to take advantage of what is poised to become a sought-after area for businesses who see the ability to service two of the country's biggest cities to the north and south.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Smith says Huntly businesses are waiting for the opening of a 15km stretch of SH1 road bypassing the town to become a reality. “It will take heavy trucks and transport outside of the town boundaries and rid Huntly of the barriers making vehicle entrance into the main street off the state highway difficult,” he says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The bypass will wake up the town instead of killing it and the commercial area is expected to become desirable with increasing property values. Pokeno, up the road, is a good example. The SH1 bypass had a positive effect on its growth and Huntly is set to follow.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Already, the town is becoming a first home choice for commuters and buyers from Auckland, 93km away; and Hamilton, 32km down the road; looking for cheaper land and housing and businesses wanting more affordable premises but still within an easy distance of both the main areas. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“It’s easy to see why the region has been chosen by many as an alternative to the bigger cities , offering ready access to both with the benefits of a small town community and lifestyle,” Smith says.  </span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/prime-property-for-midway-medical-clinic/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

            "cleanhtml": "<font color=\"#000000\"><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Unmet demand within the commercial property market, indicates that property asset values will continue increasing during the remainder of this year, says Richard Carr, senior research analyst for CBRE.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Capital confidence in New Zealand is high and investors are branching out well beyond the traditional commercial investment avenues and are looking for more portfolio diversification,” Carr says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“CBRE consistently talks about the ‘dry powder’ available for deployment into real estate around the world and our latest estimates have in excess of $100 billion available for investment into the Asia Pacific region, which includes New Zealand. Mega investors like Singaporean GIC, Canadian PSP and Blackstone have led the charge here with large scale confidence in New Zealand and the copycat effect is quite noticeable.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Brent McGregor, who heads CBRE’s capital markets team in New Zealand, states that the last 12 months have seen an average of 6.1 offers per sales campaign - meaning that for every transaction that occurs, there are five bidders still looking for a deal. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The average number of bids per deal is still stable to increasing,” McGregor says. “With the latest observation being that the locals have started to successfully compete with the historically more aggressive offshore bidders.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Carr says the agency has witnessed an increasing demand from a range of investor groups. “This demand is coming from around the world, and not only for traditional office, retail and industrial assets. Local investors are particularly active and competitive in the commercial property market;  this is not just high net worth private investors, but also syndication groups.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Syndicators ramped up more than $440m of acquisitions last year and this trend has continued into 2019 with sustained demand for a range of commercial property assets in a variety of locations. Syndicators have usually been more focused on the Auckland market, but have recently been looking further afield to Wellington, Christchurch and Tauranga to source purchase opportunities.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Carr says the low interest rate environment appears to be here to stay. “As a result, people are having to look further afield than the traditional term deposits; which is where increased syndication accessibility into the commercial property market offers leveraged distribution yields sitting between 6 per cent and 9 per cent.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span><img alt=\"True Commercial - 345 Queen St - ACG building - REDUCED.jpg\" rel=\"40246\" src=\"/media/97839/true-commercial-345-queen-st-acg-building-reduced.jpg?width=500&amp;height=297.3267866884888\"/></span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>At this point in the cycle, Carr says that liquidity confidence – the ability to enter and, sometimes more importantly, exit a market – is helping investors to realise capital and find more purchasers when they want to sell.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>He says the current weight of investment capital, has significantly improved liquidity levels across a variety of commercial property asset classes.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Liquidity improvements have been gaining momentum for a few years and seem set to continue. This momentum continues to support vendors and purchasers alike as market activity and inquiry at strong levels supports commercial property transactions</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“When capital demand is strong, relative returns drive investment decisions and influence liquidity. Buyers are constantly assessing the returns available in New Zealand versus other investment destinations and returns available here are weighted against competing returns and adjusted for specific market influences including gearing and hedging costs. Right now, all of New Zealand’s ingredients are delivering up a fairly compelling story which local and foreign buyers like.” </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>McGregor says that with considerable bid coverage and investor demand increasing from a range of purchaser types, sourcing quality investment opportunities is vital.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“CBRE has a range of investment properties available now with campaigns running for the sale of 48 Greys Avenue and 345 Queen St, both within the Auckland CBD.” </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>He says there have been strong inquiry levels for both properties. “These are two very different buying opportunities - one attracting ‘value add’ capital and the other ‘long lease’ capital, with minimal crossover on the inquiry lists. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The Greys Ave property comprises a six-level office building constructed in 1970s and refurbished in 2009 which is being marketed as a mortgagee sale by McGregor and Warren Hutt by deadline private treaty closing 4pm on Thursday July 4 - unless sold earlier.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The building has a net letabble area of 6819sq m and occupies a high profile freehold site of 1650sq m,” Hutt says. “Typical floor plates are 895sq m in area and the property has 39 secure car parks located on two levels.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>He says the property is zoned City Centre under the part operative Auckland Unitary Plan and is surrounded by amenities including the upcoming Aotea City Rail Link (CRL) station. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>McGregor says 48 Greys Avenue is a perfect example of a property presenting an opportunity to inject capital in order to add value. “It has a high land value component with significant redevelopment potential. Its flexible zoning permits a variety of uses including offices, accommodation, education, entertainment, hotels and retail. It is ideally located for redevelopment into hotel, apartments or student accommodation or alternatively upgrade for modern office use.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span><img alt=\"True Commercial - Uku Apartments Hobsonville Point - artist's impression - REDUCED.jpg\" rel=\"40247\" src=\"/media/97840/true-commercial-uku-apartments-hobsonville-point-artists-impression-reduced.jpg?width=500&amp;height=310.479375696767\"/></span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Nearby, McGregor, Hutt and colleague Mark Maginness, are marketing 345 Queen St for sale via a deadline private treaty process that closed at 4pm Thursday June 27.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“This six-level Auckland building, in the heart of the city’s tertiary education precinct, was offered as a sale and lease back opportunity with a long-term triple net lease,” Hutt says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“On the market for the first time since its construction, this is an investment property that will take care of itself.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Situated on an elevated 2032sq m site adjoining Myers Park, on the corner of Queen St and Mayoral Drive, the freehold property is owned and tenanted by ACG Pathways, a well-established private education provider that runs preschools, schools and vocational colleges at over 50 campuses across Australasia.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“It’s strategically located close to tertiary education providers including the University of Auckland and AUT’s city centre campus,” Hutt says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Most of the levels in the building, with floor plates range from 850sq m to 1100sq m, are structured in a classroom style and are designed to maximise natural light.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Hutt says the current net annual passing income is $2.4m with the lease allowing for strong annual fixed rent growth of 3 per cent per annum.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>He says the triple net lease and 20-year weighted average lease term (WALE) on 345 Queen St demonstrate a long lease opportunity with structured rental increases.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Investment in an asset with such structural certainty will enable investors to increase the WALE of their portfolios, while also diversifying occupier exposure into the education sector. The education sector, in some ways, has very similar characteristics to government tenants with these assets being highly sought after. And, the stability given through long lease property can ensure an investor’s position as the economic cycle slows.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Carr adds that another commercial property area that is catching the eye is the emerging Build-to-Rent (BTR) sector.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>This is backed up by Tamba Carleton, CBRE’s Senior Research Analyst, who last week released CBRE’s Build-to-Rent: Who? What? Where? research report, which examines the shortcomings of the region’s current market, highlights who the early adopters of BTR product are, and where projects may be built across the Pacific region.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Long a commercial development opportunity in the USA, we’re also seeing BTR in the UK and Australia; while the first multi-unit developments specifically intended to provide long-term rental housing are now emerging in New Zealand,” says Carr.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The small existing stock of two developments offering 96 units at Uku Apartments at Hobsonville Point, and NZ Defence Force Housing at Whenuapai, represent the front end of a growth pipeline of 543 units in 12 developments, and significant future potential.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Given the factors underpinning occupier demand and what from some aspects is a compelling investment rationale, we do expect BTR to become a growth sector in New Zealand.”</span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/three-prime-properties-for-an-insatiable-market/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

A large warehouse, a smaller building and big yard, or a clean industry factory could be erected on the property,” he says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The comparative cost of acquiring a site that is fully developed makes this an attractive proposition. For companies wanting to relocate their business to Hawke's Bay there are daily flights to Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington, making it an enviable headquarters for large industrial operators.”  </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Napier's main Industrial zone allows for a wide range of land uses in the Onekawa, Awatoto, and Pandora precincts. Each of the areas have a range of both industrial and commercial activity. Onekawa has a significant retailing component in addition to the diverse manufacturing and light service industries.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Hawke's Bay's economy is underpinned by a robust primary sector. The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) predicts continued strong growth in the pip fruit, wine and forestry sectors, the main exports from Hawke's Bay. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Evans says Napier Port is consequently experiencing exponential growth in export volumes and this has been accelerated by capturing substantial business that once exported through the Port of Wellington.</span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/bare-land-industrial-site-in-napier-s-onekawa/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Z Pier, where the Billfish restaurant and bar is located, is the commercial hub of Westhaven Marina – servicing more than 50 charter operators and chandlery businesses.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The marina accommodates more than 2000 sailing craft and motor vessels – both moored and in stacked storage warehousing.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Westhaven is also home to four yacht clubs, in addition to the Ponsonby Sailing School, the Auckland Dragon Boat Club, the Etchell Fleet, and the charity Sailability which offers on-water experiences for people with disabilities.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The northerly-facing al-fresco deck looks out over hundreds of pleasure craft moored at Westhaven Marina, with the Auckland Harbour Bridge beyond the breakwater, and the suburbs of the North Shore on the horizon,” says Hanson.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Unless booked for private functions, Billfish operates for breakfasts, lunches and afternoon tapas on Tuesday and Wednesdays, then for breakfast, lunch and dinner service from Thursday through to Sunday.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Billfish is very much a destination establishment, although the growing residential population of apartment dwellers in the Wynyard Quarter is bringing in a new clientele as occupation of the blocks increases.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Weekend visitor numbers have grown significantly over the past five years with the construction of the bike path linking the Viaduct, Wynyard Quarter and Silo Park precincts with the Westhaven Marina breakwater and lower inner-harbour facing approach of the harbour bridge.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“There is also the opportunity to increase the number of weddings and functions hosted at Billfish through target marketing to that niche clientele,” Hanson says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Peterson says that with the America’s Cup looming large in the summer of 2021, Billfish will be one of several waterfront hospitality establishments poised to see a growth in turnover from the corporate sector looking for food and beverage services directly linked to the racing.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“This can either be as a morning venue serving the likes of coffee and muffins before spectators head off for the day from Westhaven Marina; or as an evening entertaining venue when spectator craft and their passengers come back into port at the end of the day’s racing,” he says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“If the past America’s Cup events are the benchmarks to go by, business will be corporate focused during the week, and then will be personal and leisure orientated over the weekends. this allows for venues such as Billfish to target-market their food and beverage options accordingly.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The benefit of also having split foodservice areas means Billfish can operate two functions simultaneously, or allocate just the upstairs portion to hosting a private event or wedding while still allowing general public access to the lower floor and alfresco areas.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“That’s a flexibility many hospitality operations simply can’t offer because of their design lay-out.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Peterson says the Billfish businesses will suit an already established cafe or restaurant operator with a marketing-orientated background; looking for a venue that will allow them to increase the number of hours they are open for.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>A full suite of fittings, furnishings, cutlery, crockery and stock is included in the Billfish sale – making it a virtual ‘turn-key’ operation, he says.</span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/billfish-a-good-catch-in-westhaven-marina/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

They all feature in Bayleys’ latest Total Property portfolio magazine.</p><p>In the Far North, the historic Marlin Hotel overlooking Whangaroa Harbour encompasses the accommodation and food and beverage activities associated with a long-standing Kiwi country hotel, as well as a budget backpacker operation.</p><p>The land, buildings and Marlin Hotel business at 576 – 578 Whangaroa Road are being marketed for sale at auction on November 27 through Bayleys Kerikeri. Salespeople Irene Bremner and Anthony van Gessel said the Marlin Hotel’s fully licensed hospitality business operated from an 855 square metre two storey premises sitting on some 1,265 square metres of land.</p><p>“To modern customer demands, the Marlin’s food and beverage offerings have been segregated into a breakfast and lunch-focused café setting, and the more traditional ‘pub grub’ dining options served in the evening and for events or functions,” Ms Bremner said.</p><p>“Both activities are sustained by the same commercial-grade kitchen, although they are currently seasonally ‘dormant’ as the owners have chosen to concentrate on building up the accommodation side of the business.</p><p>“The café now has both an indoor and al-fresco seating arrangement – with a cabana overlooking the newly created deck area. Meanwhile, the licensed restaurant adjacent to the bar currently hosts up to 38 patrons.”</p><p>The main Marlin Hotel building features seven guest bedrooms on its upper floor – configured into a range of single and king-size bed sleeping arrangements, and a two-bedroom family suite. A separate bungalow-style building within the property houses three backpacker-style rooms supported by shared bathroom facilities.</p><p>Mr van Gessel said the Marlin Hotel had undergone a comprehensive renovation and decor modernisation programme over the past 12 months – creating a ‘family-friendly’ dining establishment to replace what was the former pub dining space.</p><p><img alt=\"GEORGIATairua-Pauanui-Sports-Fishing-Club-at-11-Tui-Terrace.jpg\" rel=\"53334\" src=\"/media/98096/georgiatairua-pauanui-sports-fishing-club-at-11-tui-terrace.jpg?width=500&amp;height=288.5135135135135\"/></p><p>“Kiwi country pubs have undergone a renaissance over the past decade – with the likes of the Duke of Marlborough in the Bay of Islands, the Theatre Royal in Kumara on the West Coast of the South Island, and the legendary Whangamomona Hotel in the Central North Island spearheading the trend and all becoming tourist destinations in their own rights. With the right marketing, Whangaroa could be among that echelon,” Mr van Gessel said.</p><p>“From the outside, The Marlin Hotel looks as gracious and imposing as it did at the turn of the last century when it was first built. The interior now however reflects an inviting and modern atmosphere ready for ‘turn-key’ operation in time for summer.”</p><p>Whangaroa is the harbourside departure and arrival point for big game charter fishing boats heading out to the Cavalli Islands and Great Exhibition Bay to the north just below Cape Reinga. It is also a base for free independent tourists visiting the beach attractions of the Karikari Peninsula to the north and Matauri Bay and Tauranga Bay to the south.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the Coromandel Peninsula, the management rights to one of the biggest commercial accommodation providers of its type in the area - Admiralty Lodge at 71 Buffalo Beach Road - are being jointly marketed for sale by tender through Bayleys Hamilton and Bayleys Whitianga, with the tender process closing on December 5.</p><p>Salespeople Josh Smith and Belinda Sammons said the Admiralty Lodge’s 18 rooms were configured in a combination of studio and one-bedroom units - each with their own self-contained cooking amenities and overlooking an in-ground swimming pool. The lodge’s predominantly rectangular structure directly faces toward Buffalo Beach across the road.</p><p>Mr Smith said nightly rack rates at Admiralty Lodge ranged upwards of $250 – reflecting the venue’s four-star Qualmark rating and amenity standards. The management rights business for sale includes a unit-titled two-bedroom owner/manager’s residences and adjacent staff kitchen and office space.</p><p>“The property trades without food and beverage operations on site – allowing the managers to concentrate purely on the marketing and provision of accommodation services,” Mr Smith said. “The restaurants and cafes of Whitianga are literally just two kilometre away.</p><p>“Through the introduction of numerous musical, arts and cultural concerts and festivals, Whitianga has expanded its visitor appeal from being purely a summer seaside town to being year-round weekend-break destination drawing clientele from the ‘Golden Triangle’ population bases of Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga which are all within easy driving distance.</p><p>“Occupancy rates at Admiralty Lodge have benefited from this increased tourism traffic to Whitianga as a consequence – and being at the upper echelon of accommodation providers in town, have outperformed the general motel sector.”</p><p>Mr Smith said the Admiralty Lodge’s management rights business was being sold with a sloid inventory of future bookings already in place well into 2020, and a detailed calendar of marketing activities planned for the lodge.</p><p>Rounding out the trio of waterfront hospitality venues for sale, the land and buildings which have housed the Tairua Pauanui Sports Fishing Club at 11 Tui Terrace in Tairua on the Coromandel are also being jointly marketed for sale at auction on November 28 through Bayleys Hamilton and Bayleys Whitianga.</p><p>Salespeople Josh Smith and Belinda Sammons said the combined floor area of 298 square metre fishing club building sitting on 780 square metres of land was directly located across the road from Tairua Wharf which acts as the ferry landing, and adjacent public boat-launching ramp.</p><p>“With a booming membership of more than 550 keen anglers, the Tairua Pauanui Sports Fishing Club has outgrown its current premises – so the land and buildings are being sold with vacant possession,” Mr Smith said.</p><p>“There is the potential, subject of course to council consent, to exercise ‘existing use’ rights for the location to take advantage of its apex waterfront location close to the centre of town, in addition to car parking for some 12 vehicles,“ Mr Smith said.</p><p>“The hospitality and food and beverage services infrastructure within the club are included in the sale – including the commercial grade kitchen, bar facilities and bathrooms – providing the ‘bones’ for any new operator to reformat the premises into a bar or restaurant entity.”</p><p>The venue’s car park flows seamlessly into the adjacent Thames-Coromandel District Council-owned car park utilised by passengers sailing on the Tairua ferry.</p><p>“There has been a synergy between both car parks and the fishing club’s committee is hopeful this could continue. Such an evolution would of course support the establishment of a bar and restaurant facility, which could of course draw on ferry passengers as potential clientele,” Mr Smith said.</p><p>“Upstairs, the premises consists of an open plan layout looking directly out onto the harbour, in a Lockwood home-style decor. At ground-level there is covered vehicle parking and storage space, which, with appropriate approvals, could conceivably be converted into additional seating capacity for a hospitality business.

ASB will sign a new initial lease with a two-year term from the date of settlement.”</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>The building has a carpeted street level floor of 266sq m and a 148sq m level above. Over the years the property has undergone significant renovation, with the most recent in the early 2000s.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>Inside, the premises were used by the bank for ground floor retail and offices - with two access points to a stairwell leading to the upper level which has an existing office fit-out along with a kitchenette and toilets.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>Off-street parking is provided by the plaza's 1400 open and undercover car parks. In front of the property is one of the main parking lots, with dual access along Pakuranga Rd, Ti Rakau Dr and Aylesbury St.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>A rear door within the premises gives access along a service lane and through a gate to the eastern side of the building, which has a seismic rating of 70 per cent new build standard (NBS).</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>Lee says that, as a retail property, the building is open to many potential uses – a cafe, restaurant or takeaway store, along with any type of shopping that’s acceptable within the plaza's mix.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>“The plaza, covering 28,000sq m of retail space, has a mix of about 80 internal and strip retail tenancies. It has about five million people passing through its doors annually and has a strong residential catchment with the population of the wider Howick Local Board area expected to reach 160,000 by 2030,” Lee says.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>“Presenting a blank canvas, and with a favourable Auckland Council zoning of Business - Town Centre, which has a general height control of 48.5m, the property is suitable either for an owner-occupier to move in immediately and refurbish to their business style and needs; or an investor with a tenant; or a developer because of its commercial and residential development potential,” he says.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>This would fit in with the plans of Pakuranga Plaza's main owner to substantially redevelop the mall and its 4ha site into a town centre in the near future. Previously announced plans have included commercial, retail and residential buildings.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>Anchor tenants are already onboard. The Warehouse's lease runs until 2035, Farmers has renewed its lease, and supermarket operator Countdown is staying on its site.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>The company's planning is being finalised and consents are being sought now that the $1.4 billion Auckland-Manukau Eastern Transport Initiative's (AMETI) proposed plans for the eastern busway's final alignments with roading - and the Pakuranga bus interchange’s location at the town centre with access points - have been settled.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>The busway will ease congestion and provide more tr<span>ansport options. Construction has started on the busway lanes along Lagoon Dr and Pakuranga Rd.</span></span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>Wyatt says the property's location at Pepler St directly faces Pakuranga Rd, which benefits from its immediate surroundings along the northwest side of the mall close to Countdown and a Flight Centre. </span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>“The mall is a popular shopping area which has been at the heart of the eastern suburbs for more than 50 years and has more than 120,000 cars passing daily,” Wyatt says.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>GYP Properties, a subsidiary of Singaporean listed company Global Yellow Pages, bought Pakuranga Plaza from Ladstone Holdings in 2014, but its history goes back further than that.</span></p><p class=\"x_Textbody\"><span>Built in 1965 on a site originally called Cabbage Tree Swamp, the mall, once owned by Westfield and called Westfield Pakuranga, was New Zealand's second mall of the modern age, incorporating  Farmers and George Court department stores.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\"><span>The mall has been transformed several times since it first went up and now retains little of the 1960s’ style it once had.</span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/income-earning-atm-with-former-pakuranga-bank/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

            "cleanhtml": "<font color=\"#000000\"><div>Over half a hectare of land in a busy corner position on the Wairau Valley’s main arterial road offers a host of future add-value possibilities.</div><div></div><div>Located at 75 View Road, at the intersection with Wairau Road on Auckland’s North Shore, the underutilised 5,778sqm site is zoned for potential multi-level development up to 20 metres high. It also comes with approximately 2,109sqm of retail, hospitality and office premises with 16 tenancies currently generating net annual rental income of $582,013 plus GST.</div><div></div><div>The property, a trophy listing in Bayleys’ final Total Property portfolio for the year, is for sale by tender, closing closing 4pm Thursday, 5th December 2019 unless sold prior.  It is being marketed by Terry Kim and Ranjan Unka of Bayleys North Shore Commercial in conjunction with Nigel McNeill of Bayleys central Auckland office.  </div><div></div><div>“Large properties with corner exposure on Wairau Road are highly sought after and tightly held so they rarely come up for sale,” says Kim. “This one is located on the busiest part of Wairau Road, around 500 metres from the northern motorway’s Tristram Avenue on and off ramps and on the route to and from the nearby Link Drive bulk retail precinct.”</div><div></div><div>Ranjan Unka says a major point of difference which adds long-term value to the property is its new zoning under the Auckland Unitary Plan. 75 View Road sits within a Built Environment Identified Growth Corridor Overlay. This zoning is applied to a limited number of significant road corridors, in this case Wairau Road which is a major arterial route between Glenfield and Takapuna.</div><div></div><div>“The purpose of this overlay is to provide additional opportunity for retail activities, particularly large format retail, not typically provided for in the underlying zoning which is Light Industry.</div><div></div><div>“It means this site has more future development flexibility than most properties in the Wairau Valley which have the standard Light Industry zoning. The overlay allows for multi-storey development up to 20m in height and a mix of potential uses including retail, hospitality, office, industrial or car dealerships, subject of course to obtaining any necessary resource consents.”</div><div></div><div>In the meantime, Terry Kim says a variety of well-established occupants are producing substantial income for the next owner to enjoy, with the ability to also add immediate value by leasing up two vacant tenancies. This would provide potential additional income of approximately $60,000pa.</div><div></div><div>The larger of two separate building developments on the site, located on its Wairau Road frontage, is generating the majority of the property’s cashflow. Built in the 1980s, the 1,384sqm premises is occupied by the Wairau Sports Bar, which has a gaming lounge, a neighhouring liquor store and an upstairs karaoke bar, with a 453sqm Asian supermarket at the rear in a former warehouse building.</div><div></div><div>Terry Kim says these tenancies have been in place since the early 2000s. There is also 120sqm of empty ground floor space which would suit food and beverage or retail use.</div><div></div><div>A separate 918sqm two-level building was added at the rear of the site not long after the current owner acquired the property in 2004. “This provides a good standard of modern commercial accommodation, with retail tenancies on the ground floor and office suites above,” says Terry Kim.</div><div></div><div>This building has 12 tenancies ranging in size from 40sqm to 117sqm. Ground floor tenants include restaurants, a hair salon, florist and butchery.</div><div></div><div>The overall site has extensive asphalt sealing and parking for approximately 88 cars located at the front of the Sports Bar and between the two buildings. There are two access points off View Road.</div><div></div><div>Terry Kim says tenants include a variety of Korean businesses which benefit from significant patronage from the North Shore’s substantial Korean population. He says occupants are a mix of small to medium sized businesses, providing a good split risk opportunity for investors.</div><div></div><div>Ranjan Unka says 75 View Road is strategically located in the heart of the Wairau Valley’s commercial precinct with good transport links to central Auckland, Takapuna and Albany making it very accessible for staff and customers.</div><div></div><div>“The Wairau Valley is one of the North Shore’s longest established commercial and industrial areas, and has experienced a diversification of activities in more recent times from its predominantly industrial base. This is especially so on Wairau Road which now has a mixture of showroom, bulk retail and smaller retail outlets as well as car sales yards.”</div><div></div><div>A Giltrap Holden dealership is located next door to 75 View Road and directly opposite, on the other side of View Road, is the Wairau Junction Retail Centre. This is a recently redeveloped food and beverage and convenience retail centre with 22 tenancies which have been unit titled and sold off individually to investors.</div><div></div><div>A wide range of bulk retail outlets are located along nearby Link Drive while massive Pak’nSave, Bunnings and Mitre10 stores are also situated close to Wairau Road.</div><div></div><div>Longer term, Ranjan Unka says 75 View Road’s level, rectangular site, with dual access ways, could lend itself to a staged partial or full redevelopment.</div><div></div><div>“The newer building at the rear of the site has shorter term leases than the front building so this part of the property could potentially be more intensively redeveloped first.</div><div></div><div> “Alternatively, the next owner could simply focus on adding value to the existing premises and tenancy mix, with the underlying land value also likely to keep increasing.”</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/prime-corner-shore-site-offers-big-future-upside/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

He notes that neighbouring buildings house a psychologist and a dentistry practice – the types of practices the property for sale would be ideal for.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“The main open-plan office area has multiple connections for power, phone and data – enabling a work hub that can cater for dozens of staff. This area is supported by two private offices for management, consultation or meeting rooms depending on a new owner's needs.</span></p><p class=\"x_Standard\">“The previous tenant had 34 staff working within this property for two-years, but the business rapidly outgrew the premises and was forced to move on.”</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><a name=\"x__Hlk10372038\"></a><span>At the rear of the building are staff facilities including unisex toilets and </span><a name=\"x__Hlk10371987\"></a><span><span>amenities for the disable</span></span><span>d, a kitchen and staff room.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Keane says the interior is flooded by natural light from double glazed aluminium joinery windows. Vented air-conditioning provided by one central unit is capable of maintaining the entire work space at a controlled climate.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“Ready for occupation by a new owner-occupier, or property investor with a tenant in mind, it has a Waipa District Council valuation rating of $580,000,” he says.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>“No development or refurbishment of the property is needed as it meets the latest building standards, is low maintenance and has easy care grounds. The brick and tile cladding require minimal input to maintain its professional appearance.”</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Originally a residential site, the owner built a new house at the rear of the property and had the front portion rezoned to commercial 8A, then erected the office building.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Smith says the front of the open plan office could easily be partitioned or reconfigured internally, however; the property cannot be reconverted to residential use.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>He says the property could also suit businesses associated with the equine sector.  Cambridge is the equine capital of New Zealand where some of the world's best thoroughbred racehorses are bred in premier studs surround the town. The industry provides more than 600 jobs in the Waikato, with many based in and around Cambridge.</span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>The property could also be suitable for national sports bodies needing administration headquarters in the region, Smith says. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Cambridge and nearby Lake Karapiro have become the centres for national sports organisations such rowing, kayaking, canoeing, triathlon; track, road, mountain and BMX biking. </span></p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span>Cambridge is 24 kilometres southeast of Hamilton, and is home to 19,150 people in the heart of Waikato's rural region.</span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/modern-cambridge-office-building/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

            "cleanhtml": "<font color=\"#000000\"><div>A large and unique office and retail investment opportunity within Auckland’s Southern Corridor has come onto the market.</div><div></div><div>Situated on 49 Main Highway in Ellerslie, the asset consists of three interlocking buildings covering a regular shaped site area of 3,209sq m, equating to a total floor area of 5,131sq m.</div><div></div><div>The three buildings all offer unique floorplates and range from typical office fit-outs to character options and smaller office suites, mitigating risk by appealing to different occupiers with a diverse offering. The ground floor retail also offers additional on-site amenity through a café provider.</div><div></div><div>JLL Commercial Sales Broker Ian Hall says the distinction of buildings can be of great benefit to potential investors.</div><div></div><div>“In conjunction with high quality anchor tenants like ZAG, Hello Fresh, and Yellow Fox that are all leaders in their individual fields, the asset also houses smaller tenants using the suites as incubators to grow and develop with the potential to be filtered into larger spaces within the asset moving forward,” says Hall.</div><div></div><div>“There is a real community feel across the three buildings as the tenants enjoy a quality service within the high-spec space, with regular internal events and a significant amount of the leasing done by word of mouth.”</div><div></div><div>The property is best defined by three different buildings that are all interconnected.</div><div></div><div>From the front, ‘Unit A’ is located on the right side of the site. Its entry is through the foyer which includes a large stairwell providing access to the basement and ground floor parking levels, in addition to two further floors of office space with a good stud height and natural light.</div><div></div><div>The middle building, Unit I (Sawtooth) features a large foyer area and a rear ground floor unit with smaller tenancies on the first floor and the level one showroom space. The offices and suites in this area provide a character feel through the large stud height, polished wooden floors, and funky fit-outs.</div><div></div><div>Meanwhile, the final building (Annex) consists of a ground floor showroom with three additional levels of offices and decks on both ends with views over Main Highway and Ellerslie Primary School. There are 135 on-site carparks servicing the asset, with 127 of these within the two levels of secure parking space.</div><div></div><div>Hall says there is a huge add-value opportunity through greater management of the tenancies. “Subject to confirmation, the asset already brings in a net rental of approximately $1.3 million,” he says.</div><div></div><div>“There is potential to streamline the terms of the leases to create strong rental growth moving forward. Renegotiating leases due to expire over the next 24 months, creating occupier spatial growth within the asset and introducing fixed rental increases will provide more certainty around future cash flow growth.”</div><div></div><div>In terms of location, the Main Highway connects Great South Road and the Ellerslie Panmure Highway, two of Auckland’s main arterial routes. Hall says the asset is fortuitously placed between State Highway 1 access from both the Ellerslie and Greenlane roundabouts, making it easily accessible from all areas of Auckland including the Auckland Airport.</div><div></div><div>“In addition to being located in favourable Business Mixed Use zoning, the site benefits from superb public transport options including nearby bus stops and the Ellerslie Train Station which is a three minute walk away,” says Hall.</div><div></div><div>“The motorway overbridged access to the station itself also leads to the Ellerslie Town Centre with the retail strip offering restaurants, pubs, and additional amenity like Anytime Fitness, Kiwibank and Achilles General Store. Other amenities within the local vicinity include Cornwall Park, Countdown Greenlane, Ascot Hospital, and the Ellerslie Racecourse.”</div><div></div><div>The location itself is renowned as the Southern Corridor of the Auckland Office market, which is a popular precinct for both local and global occupiers due to its large floorplates, accessibility, and affordability.</div><div></div><div>According to JLL research, the Southern Corridor has maintained stable demand over 2019 with vacancy rates declining to 10 per cent due to the continued occupier interest. Meanwhile rents have stabilised with average face rentals sitting at $273 per sqm as at September 2019.</div><div></div><div>JLL is exclusively offering 49 Main Highway for sale by way of Deadline Private Treaty closing at 4pm on November 28.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/three-auckland-office-buildings-in-one/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

This changed mid-2017, though, when the new Earthquake-prone Building Amendment Act came into force.</div><div></div><div>According to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, all old Earthquake Prone Building notices have been carried forward, so if a building had a yellow sticker under the old system, it will be reissued with a new notice in accordance with the new system.</div><div></div><div>The earthquake-prone building register indicates there are 735 earthquake prone buildings in Wellington.  </div><div></div><div>McIlroy says strengthened and refurbished buildings are popular with tenants looking for character space.</div><div></div><div>Another such building at 60 Cuba Street, Te Aro, sold in 2016, was strengthened and refurbished and is now tenanted by Highwater eatery on the ground floor with the character office space on the upper level also fully leased.</div><div></div><div>In 2015 the building that houses Floriditas and Best Ugly Bagels, at 161 Cuba St, was bought by an investor who has also undertaken the same process.</div><div></div><div>“Demand for strengthened character space is always strong in Wellington. Tenants like being involved with the whole transformation of the building and their fit out can be done in conjunction with the strengthening.”</div><div></div><div>He says Te Aro is a rapidly changing area, close to Victoria University’s School of Architecture and Design, numerous apartment buildings and retail stores, whilst also being a stone’s throw from the best restaurants, cafes and bars in Wellington, including Havana, Logan Brown, Prefab, Cafe L’Affare, Ombra, Floriditas and Light House Cinema.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/former-printing-house-offers-character-in-popular-te-aro/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

CBRE Australia, together with Colliers International, will market the properties offshore.</p><p>“These properties have performed well for our investors, but the fund was created to run for a fixed term and that has triggered the sale process,” says Lendlease manager Matt Bowyer.</p><p>“We expect the portfolio will be strongly sought by domestic and international parties, given the assets’ strong fundamentals and long-term financial performance.”</p><p>John Goddard, of Colliers’ New Zealand capital markets team, says the strength of the Dress Smart brand has resulted in the Onehunga centre being an outstanding performer.</p><p>“The portfolio provides immediate scale with an overall gross lettable area of 36,362.4sq m. The total portfolio is expected to attract interest in excess of NZ$350 million.</p><p>“This is a unique opportunity to dominate the outlet market in New Zealand while investing in the best shopping centre in the lower half of the South Island.”</p><p>Richard Kirke, international sales director at Colliers New Zealand, says the Onehunga outlet centre is in a futureproof location, thanks to continuing high-level plans by Auckland Council for the transformation of Onehunga.</p><p>“Recent investment in a new train station, road improvements, the main street and Taumanu Reserve has created impressive urban regeneration in Onehunga and its surrounds.</p><p>“Median house prices have more than doubled from 2012-2019 and prices will continue to rise given the re-gentrification being undertaken. Also in time the proposed east-west motorway link and light rail link from the airport to the Auckland CBD will further improve accessibility.”</p><p>Dress Smart Onehunga opened in 1995 and is at 151 Arthur St. It has a gross lettable area of 13,217sq m on an 18,858sq m freehold site with 735 car parks and Business Town Centre zoning. The centre has 99 per cent occupancy as at July 2019, with 101 tenants in total.</p><p>Dress Smart Hornby in Christchurch is the South Island’s only dedicated outlet. Its high-profile location along State Highway 1 has strong exposure to passing traffic. <br/>“With no direct competition, the centre serves a trade area population of 465,694. This is significantly broader than traditional shopping centres,” says Kirke.</p><p>Hornby is a major residential and retail suburb at the western edge of Christchurch, only 7km from the CBD and 11km from the airport.</p><p>Its affluent residential population includes a high proportion of families. This, coupled with strong population growth, provides a demographic that associates strongly with outlet shopping centres as they look for value options.</p><p>Dress Smart Hornby is part of a broader, complementary shopping destination that includes The Hub Hornby, a Countdown supermarket and a range of large format retail stores.</p><p>The centre opened in 1998 and is at 409 Main South Rd. It has a gross lettable area of 7117sq m on a 12,195sq m site with 347 car parks and Commercial Core zoning. It has 99 per cent occupancy as at June 2019, with 53 tenancies including 47 specialty shops.</p><p>Lachlan MacGillivray of Colliers International Australia says: “Given the properties offer geographic and sector diversification, with proven sales growth over a long period of time, there is likely to be a broad buyer base for these assets. There is global investment demand for outlet centres.”</p><p>Kirke says Christchurch and Auckland will typically be well known to offshore investors. “Dunedin is less well known, but nevertheless will be attractive due to its population growth and the council’s significant infrastructure investment in both the hospital and its CBD.</p><p>“The Meridian Mall sits on nearly 1ha of prime CBD land. Opened in 1997 the centre is the dominant retail centre for a growing primary catchment of 126,000 people, according to a recent IQ report.</p><p>“Anchored by Kmart, JB HiFi and well-recognised South Island department store H&amp;J Smith, the centre enjoys being in the hub of the ‘Golden Block’ main trade area. Here, retail spending power is estimated at over $2 billion.”</p><p>Meridian Mall is at 285 George St. It has a gross lettable area of 16,028.4sq m on a 9398sq m site with 650 car parks. The centre has 95 per cent occupancy as at June 2019, with 65 tenancies.</p><p>Simon Rooney, of CBRE Australia, says commercial real estate continues to be sought as its risk-adjusted returns remain attractive.</p><p>The closing date for offers is 4pm Thursday, November 21.</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/dress-smart-outlets-dunedin-mall-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

A two kilometre truck access road has been formed to the quarrying site. The Rangiatea road site is not open to the public and is the river pebble base of supply.</div><div></div><div>The business is being marketed by sale by tender closing on November 1 through Bayleys Waikato salespeople Mike Swanson and Alex ten Hove.</div><div></div><div>Mr. Swanson said the business has relevant consents from the Otorohanga District Council and Environment Waikato. “The required consents to operate the quarries are in place and a large inventory of plant and machinery have been built up for their operation.”</div><div></div><div>Additional consents to widen the entrance to the Otorohanga Road site and establish a wheel wash to eliminate dust and quarry material from being transferred to the roads, have been granted and built.</div><div></div><div>A petrological test report is available on the texture, composition and quality of the greywacke stones and the extent of the land that can be quarried.</div><div></div><div>“Only an experienced operator knows what type of land is suitable for quarrying and to do these tests determining the type of stone or rock that is available,” Mr Swanson said.</div><div></div><div>The company dry mines at both sites but only its Otorohanga Road property is open to locals and the wider market selling quarry stone and material, which are used as the basis for high-strength and decorative concrete and crushed and natural ‘fruit salad’ river stones for gardening use, pebbles, chips, base course and pit sand.</div><div></div><div>Mr Swanson said a new owner could easily upscale the operations to extract more stones. “There is room for more already consented truck and trailer journeys per day so additional extraction will not be an issue and it would enhance the business.”</div><div></div><div>Operations at the sites for predominantly unwashed high-strength rock include stripping to remove waste rock, vegetation and soil, quarrying the bedrock using heavy machinery and limited use of explosives, excavation of broken rock which is either stockpiled or transported to the plant for further crushing and screening, grading and eventual sale.</div><div></div><div>Under the license once the quarries have reached the end of their useful life the land will be rehabilitated by filling the quarry floors, reseeding the area to return it to productive pasture. Trees will also be planted at the Otorohanga Rd site.</div><div></div><div>“The business is being sold as a going concern along with motor vehicles, truck and trailers, plant and machinery, including excavators, a forklift, hydraulic scoop, tandem roller, water pumps, wheeled loaders, crushing and screening equipment and transportable buildings/containers.</div><div></div><div>“A new owner could take over the business immediately, increase its operations and reap the benefit of the long license and resource consents for operating extensive quarrying,” Mr Swanson said.</div><div></div><div>Quarrying is sometimes not all about extracting stones. When Mr Withers was clearing topsoil for dry mining river metal about 100 metres from the banks of the Waipa River eight kilometers east of Otorohanga in 2002, the digger struck what he thought to be a tree.</div><div></div><div>The parallel sides made Mr Withers realise it was not just a lump of wood. and he proceeded to carefully clear more sand away, revealing the 11.8 metre unfinished waka, the first partially constructed Waka in New Zealand to be uncovered and helping to discover some techniques of construction.</div><div></div><div>Archaeologists quickly cordoned off a 12 x 3.5 metre area, allowing the dry mining work to continue. Mr Withers sprayed water over the waka twice a day to stop the timbers drying too quickly and cracking.

The station has a fantastic fertiliser history.</div><div></div><div>Te Rangi has been run as a finishing unit, taking advantage of good summer rainfall and the ability to winter weaner Friesian bulls on kale, selling as store before the second winter, along with bulls bred on the property and finished at 18 months, also before the second winter.  </div><div></div><div>Much of Te Rangi’s finishing country is at the bottom and southern side of the farm, with reticulated water supplying all cultivatable areas.</div><div></div><div>There is the opportunity to increase Te Rangi’s stocking capacity through further cultivation and pasture renewal, while its 60 paddocks offer well sized subdivision for the block.</div><div></div><div>Te Rangi’s history has been well recounted by Adrian Heays, grandson to the property’s pioneering founder Bob Heays who settled the property after returning from Gallipoli.</div><div></div><div>Earthquakes, depression, another war and some boom-bust years have made Te Rangi a witness to almost New Zealand’s entire agricultural history, including the innovation and opportunities that have presented themselves more recently.</div><div></div><div>This included the pioneering deer farming efforts of Adrian’s father Murray. In true Kiwi fashion he took what was regarded as a noxious pest, acquired a license and started to farm them.</div><div></div><div>The halcyon early days of deer farming were spearheaded by the likes of Murray, and he recounted to Radio New Zealand in 2011 his efforts in live deer capture, the first in Hawke’s Bay.  </div><div></div><div>Capturing deer involved building a fence around the area where deer were prolific, letting them get used to going in and out the area, then simply shutting a gate into the area. Feeding them maize over the tough winter months did much to help them settle into their new domesticity.</div><div></div><div>A peaking velvet market in the eighties ensured early days were a lucrative way to build stock numbers and farming funds.</div><div></div><div>Capturing deer on the property helped raise funds to continue its improvements and was the spring board for a velvet business and bloodline imports from United Kingdom and Denmark. Red deer auctions were a regular feature of Te Rangi’s farm calendar throughout the late seventies and eighties.</div><div></div><div>Today the property does not run deer, but the facilities for handling them include two deer sheds, with all-weather access.  </div><div></div><div>There is also 460 hectares in deer fencing that encompasses 220 hectares of bush and a totara basin. Having the fencing already in place offers a valuable alternative opportunity for an interested operator keen to spread the property’s income risk.</div><div></div><div>Other improvements on the property include a spacious four bedroom homestead in the 1920s colonial style, a well-built manager’s house, shearers’ quarters and a four stand woolshed and yards.</div><div></div><div>Mr Franklin says a key feature of Te Rangi are the opportunities it offers from a well-founded, well fertilised and cared for farm base.</div><div></div><div>“This could include taking advantage of the extensive bush area and incorporating it into an eco-tourism or hunting operation. The property’s proximity to Napier airport, only 50 minutes away means it has</div><div>a level of accessibility that is quite rare for properties of this type and scale.”</div><div></div><div>Boosted by its long-standing reputation as a winery region Hawke’s Bay is now enjoying a growing reputation as New Zealand’s food bowl, with strong growth in both international and domestic tourists keen to sample the region’s high quality food and experience the environment within which it is grown.</div><div></div><div>Te Rangi’s landscape alone make it a stunning visual experience, with sweeping vistas from the station’s 911 metre high trig that span 360 degrees across the North Island from Cape Kidnappers in the east  around to north-western Lake Waikaremoana and Panekiri Bluff. Further west the volcanic peaks of Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe and Tongariro and even Taranaki can be seen on exceptionally clear days.</div><div></div><div>Its unique landscape includes the “Sandhills”, a pumice area that is the remnant of the Taupo eruption, a geological peculiarity that also explains the station’s silt and sand based loamy soils that have benefitted from regular levels of superphosphate over the years.</div><div></div><div>The unique connection to the natural world is continued by the Boundary Stream Walkway, gifted as a reserve by the Heay and neighbouring Shine families in the 1980s, including the Shine Falls, Hawke’s Bay’s highest waterfall, with many walking trails throughout.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/pioneering-deer-farm-comes-with-tourism-and-hunting-options/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

It now has 10 locations across South Auckland and two venues in Christchurch.</div><div></div><div>Bayleys’ national commercial and industrial director, Ryan Johnson, said population growth, combined with more families with two-parents working full-time, had been the key drivers of growing demand for childcare places over the past decade.</div><div></div><div>There are currently 4,544 early childhood education (ECE) locations in New Zealand, of which 160 were newly licensed in 2016. The majority of ECE centres in New Zealand – more than 85 percent – are run by small independent operators.</div><div></div><div>On average, 152 new early childhood education sites open each year.

The number of children has risen from 93.6 percent to 96.6 percent, with time spent in ECE has reached an average of 21.7 hours a week, up from 13.5 hours in 2000. The Government fully funds 20 hours of care a week for all children aged three, four and five.</div><div></div><div>“With the early childhood sector now a commercial property segment in its own right, Bayleys is seeing more and more childcare premises coming to the market – either such as these three new-build premises or as established buildings which have been converted from either residential dwellings or office spaces,” Mr Johnson said.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/childs-play-for-investors/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Rental reviews are undertaken every three years.</span></p><p><span>The Atkinson Ave property is being marketed for sale by deadline private treaty through Bayleys Auckland,<span> </span>closing on October 17. </span></p><p><span>Bayleys salespeople Ben Bayley and James Hill said the L-shaped building was serviced by a sealed car park at the rear, with room for some 42 vehicles, including seven<span>  </span>under cover<span>  </span>and five within a garage.</span></p><p><span>“Improvements to the premises, which includes the fit-out of classrooms and the commercial kitchen facility, have been undertaken at a cost of $338,225,” said Bayley.</span></p><p><span>“These features will see the tenant pay the landlord an improvements rent of $62,447 per annum commencing January 2019, with the final payment scheduled for October 2026. </span></p><p><span>“The capitalised works rent will be payable in the same manner as premises rent and will be revised in the rent review dates at the same percentage increase as the premises rent.</span></p><p><span>“For any new owner of 42 Atkinson Ave, the tenancy by the Pacific Advance Secondary School ensures a substantial holding income is derived over the medium to long term while potential redevelopment options are explored.”</span></p><p><span>Auckland Council’s business mixed-use zoning<span> </span>allows for developments which soften the demarcation line between<span> </span>commercial<span> </span>and residential areas. Subject to consents, buildings up to four storeys and a maximum hight of 18m can be built. </span></p><p><span>“This would allow for the construction of a more intensified commercial entity on the site, with the potential for the lower level to sustain covered car parking facility,” said Bayley.</span></p><p><span><span> </span>Hill said neighbouring properties around the school<span> </span>included light industrial operations in the automotive sector as well as multiple small retail premises,<span>  </span>encompassing convenience and fast food outlets, and<span> </span>neighbourhood community stores.</span></p><p><span>“Atkinson Ave is a virtual demarcation line between the residential portion of Otahuhu to the east, and the light industrial and business activities taking place to the west,”<span> </span>Hill said.</span></p><p><span>“The property is<span> l</span>ess than 9km to Manukau, less than 20 minutes to Auckland’s CBD, and within minutes of the southern motorway, Otahuhu train station and other major arterials,”<span> </span>Hill added.</span></p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/charter-school-campus/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Further development and growth within the Te Kauwhata area will create more future opportunities for this well positioned property.”</div><div></div><div>The fee simple property offers 10,390sq m of land, zoned for Country Living, and has a current rental return of $184,178.00 net per annum plus GST with an upcoming CPI rental increase in January 2020.</div><div></div><div>“Furthermore, the Te Kauwhata area continues to gain momentum with recent zoning changes and as a result is experiencing large scale housing developments and strong rejuvenation,” says Johnson.</div><div></div><div>Te Kauwhata is one of the Waikato’s fastest growing regions. The area also offers affordable housing and excellent proximity to Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga via State Highway 1. In June 2018 the Government announced that the Waikato District Council would receive a $38 million, 10 year interest free loan from the $1 billion dollar Housing Infrastructure Fund to support the township. This investment is aimed at supporting approximately 3,000 new affordable houses, expanding the water supply and building a new wastewater treatment plant, amongst other projects in the area.</div><div></div><div>The site was commissioned by the New Zealand Government and constructed in 1902 as part of the Te Kauwhata Viticulture Research Station under the expert direction of Romeo Bragato (New Zealand’s first government viticulturist). Its purpose was to be the country’s first viticulture research station where Romeo sought to unlock the secrets of the New Zealand soil.  His</div><div>goal was to establish grape varietals that would thrive in the local climate.</div><div></div><div>The site was operated as a research and wine making facility with the first wines from Te Kauwhata produced in 1903.

Currently under construction, Maketu Rd will connect with a recently completed new interchange with State Highway One.</div><div></div><div>“Offering exceptional exposure to what will be one of the busiest roads in the business park, this flat and regular shaped site is the jewel in the crown in Block One of the project and will be one of the best sites available in the whole development,” says Scott Campbell, national director, industrial for Bayleys Real Estate which has been appointed to market the site</div><div>“Maketu Rd will separate a large industrial precinct from a commercial precinct whose proposed central hub is directly opposite the land we have for sale.”</div><div></div><div>Campbell says the site’s Light Industry zoning allows for many industrial activities as of right, including light manufacturing and production, storage, logistics, transport and distribution activities.</div><div></div><div>“In particular, it could suit a company looking for a high profile branding opportunity in this landmark development which could incorporate its head office or a large showroom area to showcase its products or services.</div><div></div><div>“However, given the location of the site on a prime corner position at the beginning of the industrial area and directly opposite the commercial hub, prospective purchasers may wish to investigate the potential for any higher or better use that the site would lend itself to, subject to council approval. For example, a new owner could potentially apply for a resource consent for another complementary use such as a large trades-related bulk retail complex.”</div><div></div><div>Campbell is marketing the site with Bayleys Auckland industrial colleagues Ben Bayley, James Hill and Sunil Bhana, with expressions of interest being sought closing 24th October, unless sold prior.  </div><div></div><div>Drury South Crossing is located in the Drury basin, east of the southern motorway (SH1), between the Drury interchange to the north and the Ramarama interchange to the south. The Drury Quarry, which is located at the base of the Hunua foothills, forms the eastern edge of the Crossing site and is being incorporated into the industrial precinct.</div><div></div><div>Stevensons has recently sold this and other quarries it owned to Fulton Hogan Ltd to concentrate on the Drury South Crossing project. Following many years of planning, consultation, design work and obtaining the necessary consents, a massive earthworks and civil engineering programme is now well underway. This will provide the necessary infrastructure platform for a variety of industrial, commercial and residential buildings which are expected to start to rapidly take shape from early 2021.  </div><div>Drury South Crossing chief executive Stephen Hughes says approximately five million cubic metres of soils are being shifted as part of the earthworks which will also include the laying of 11.5  km of water supply pipes, 5.7km of waste water pipes and 8km of stormwater drainage.</div><div></div><div>He says the company has worked closely with Auckland Council, including Auckland Transport and Watercare Services, to ensure completion of major ground works is closely coordinated with various projects being undertaken by private enterprise.</div><div></div><div>Hughes says there has been strong interest in and demand for sites that have so far been released for purchase with early sales running ahead of expectations. Ten lots in Block 1 and a further nine lots in the neighbouring Block 2 have either sold unconditionally or are under conditional contract.</div><div></div><div>Land titles for these sites which range from 7000 sq m to close to two hectares are expected to be available from late next year onwards with construction of buildings likely to follow shortly thereafter. Sales to date have been to a mixture of local and national owner occupiers, investors and developers for industrial warehousing, light engineering and/or yard use.</div><div></div><div>The majority of sales so far have been to owner occupiers which Scott Campbell says is not surprising given the acute shortage of and high cost of industrial zoned land available for purchase in other parts of Auckland, particularly sites of sufficient size for businesses wanting to build big warehouses.</div><div></div><div>“In recent years, most industrial zoned land which can be built on in Auckland has been in the hands of longstanding corporate landlords who build for tenants and are long-term holders of the finished product.</div><div></div><div>“Drury South Crossing is one of the only opportunities for large-scale owner occupiers - or developers - to secure land at competitive rates. Owner occupier demand has been a key driver of the commercial and industrial property market for some time now on the back of unprecedentedly low interest rates.</div><div></div><div>“Businesses are making the most of very attractive borrowing costs to move into the property market. Buying land means they can also build exactly what they require rather than often having to compromise if they acquire an existing vacant building.</div><div></div><div>\"The larger sites at Drury South Crossing also provide the flexibility for expansion at a later stage which means companies can  future proof their position within Auckland’s next major business hub in an area which will undergo enormous growth over the next 10 to 20 years.”</div><div></div><div>Ben Bayley says another big attraction for businesses is Drury South Crossing’s pivotal position alongside SH1 on the “Golden Triangle” encompassing the key markets of Auckland, Hamilton, and Tauranga.  “It’s the perfect staging point for accessing close to 60 percent of the North Island’s population generating approximately 52 per cent of the country’s GDP.”</div><div></div><div>Bayley says Drury is set to benefit from $2 billion of infrastructure investment over the next 10 years, with with planning at various stages for town centres, retail and community facilities, a school, a railway station and a hotel.</div><div></div><div>Hughes says the Drury South Crossing concept design seeks to work with the existing topography and structure of the basin.</div><div></div><div>As well as providing a wide range of industrial, commercial and residential property, it will incorporate approximately 90 hectares of open spaces for the public to enjoy, including recreation areas, walking and cycling tracks.</div><div></div><div>An important component of this will be the restoration and enhancement of the Hingaia and Maketu Streams, which will</div><div>meander through the public spaces.</div><div></div><div>“These waterways are being remediated, and there will be extensive native planting undertaken,” says Hughes. “This will become a feature of the overall development, and a new wetland area for stormwater management will treat and improve water quality entering the Hingaia stream.”</div><div></div><div>Stevensons has sold 45ha of land between the commercial precinct and the motorway to Classic Developments which will manage the development of up to 800 houses with over 70 per cent of them to be priced below $800,000.</div><div></div><div>Hughes says Stevensons and Auckland Council have worked collaboratively to ensure there is sufficient housing within and around Drury South Crossing to provide homes for an estimated 5,000 workers who will be employed there. A large proportion are expected to live in the surrounding area.</div><div></div><div>Three new housing estates adjoin the business park and Auckland Council structure plans for Drury, Pukekohe and Paerata could see more than 23,000 new houses built in these areas over the next 15 years.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/prime-spot-in-first-stage-of-south-auckland-development/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The owner has kept one title and decided to sell the other two properties.</div><div></div><div>Solid Energy's 2193 square metre former office at 77 Rotowaro Road was built in the 1980s with an extension added a few years later. Since Solid Energy's collapse it has been reconfigured, refurbished and converted for educational purposes and was used until recently for teaching.</div><div></div><div>The nearby 2.2 hectares of bare land at 113 Rotowaro Road, previously used to graze horses, is in the transition zone between rural Huntly to the west and the town's residential infill area to the east. Although it has a business zoning, it is in the Waikato District Council's proposed new District Plan to be rezoned residential.</div><div></div><div>Both properties are being marketed for sale by tender closing on October 11 through Bayleys Hamilton salespeople Alex ten Hove and Mike Swanson.</div><div></div><div>Mr ten Hove said both properties offer substantial opportunities for an active buyer who could tenant the office building and landbank the bare land until it is rezoned residential. However, they are on the market as separate sales.</div><div></div><div>The office building on a 1.8 hectare site with on-site parking is zoned business under the Waikato District Council's District Plan and is about one kilometre from the town centre.</div><div></div><div>Originally purpose-built for Solid Energy it is ready for its next phase and is being sold with vacant possession.</div><div></div><div>Mr ten Hove said there are multiple uses for the building from childcare to education, offices, a medical centre, church or community centre. The surplus land on the site can be used for expansion of the existing building or new development.</div><div></div><div>“It can kept as a single tenancy or can be split into multiple tenancies as the air-conditioning covers the entire building. The modernised, well-constructed and maintained property includes a large kitchen and cafeteria, dining area, decks and an outdoor area meaning a large number of staff or visitors can be catered for,” he said.</div><div></div><div>“Ideally configured for numerous uses and with excellent parking, it has 215 metres of road frontage giving good visibility and access for staff and students or clients and could potentially generate yearly rent of $200,000 plus.</div><div></div><div>The nearby 2.2 hectares of undeveloped land is zoned business – heavy industrial, but is designated to become residential.</div><div></div><div>Mr ten Hove said the council is about half way through the process for a new District Plan, but there is no date for its completion.</div><div></div><div>Located on the south east site of Rotowaro Road, the site is near existing residential areas and has access off Porritt Avenue and Rotowaro Road. It's corner position gives potential for many subdivision options.</div><div></div><div>“This site is a valuable opportunity for a developer or landbanker “ Mr ten Hove said. “It will be extremely affordable, offering  a real opportunity for profit for buyers with the vision to turn the site into a housing development.</div><div></div><div>“The potential is for either affordable housing or larger residential lots. It has elevated views to the Waikato River and beyond and should be eventually sought after by people wanting new homes.” It is possible a large number of residential lots could be created on the land.</div><div></div><div>The property is just minutes from Lake Puketirini and Huntly town centre and less than two kilometres to Huntly West kindergarten, the local primary school and college.</div><div></div><div>Huntly has a population of more than 7000 people and is expected to get a new lease of life early next year once the new $409 million 15.2 kilometre four-lane motorway bypasses the township.</div><div></div><div>Mr ten Hove said the new SH1 will have a major effect on Huntly and Pokeno is a good example of how a state highway bypass has led to positive growth in all areas.

The 47 kilometre fence line offers a safe haven for many of the country's most endangered species.</div><div></div><div>At the heart of the complex is a central dining area with open plan living, high stud timber ceilings and an open fire, creating a relaxed country atmosphere for guests.</div><div></div><div>“The accommodation, with food provided, is a large part of the business, and is a major drawcard for clientele. It has attracted glowing Trip Advisor reviews. We enjoy entertaining through the restaurant, which is popular with guests, visitors and locals,” Mr Hodgson, said.</div><div></div><div>An extended intergenerational family could consider this complex as a home to accommodate them comfortably. The owner’s residence has five ensuite double bedrooms which open to a deck over the gardens, with some rooms having views to the mountain.</div><div></div><div>“With its close proximity to the local primary school over the road and the bus for Te Awamutu College passing the gate, it’s a property that is well positioned for families to access education yet enjoy the rural lifestyle. Further amenities include community tennis courts and a 20 metre swimming pool at the school.</div><div></div><div>There are other numerous alternatives for the property which could include a spa/wellness retreat, a live-in ecological study centre or boutique hotel.</div><div></div><div>Mr Macdonald said the main benefit of the property is its location, drawing guests to Sanctuary Mountain and both the Waikato River and Te Awa Cycle Trails, as well as a position near key tourist attractions - the Waitomo Caves (45 kilometres away), Rotorua, Hamilton (each one hours’ drive) and 35 minutes from Hobbiton.</div><div></div><div>The Hodgsons say the property and business would suit an owner operator or manager if a buyer wanted to continue the existing operations. “They also see potential growth through marketing and believe they have created a multi-use complex that will be a great base for future development,” Mr Macdonald said.</div><div> </div><div>The couple said they have enjoyed good times at the lodge bringing up four children and are now selling to spend more time with their grandchildren.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/complex-with-extensive-lodging-options-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

It is among the biggest horticultural production blocks in the region and has been successfully cropping avocados for nearly two decades supplying an Australian supermarket chain, Asian and Pacific markets plus locally. Last year's export crop exceeded 34,000 trays,” Mr Mangos said.</div><div></div><div>Orchard management recently planted several blocks of kiwifruit – 1.31 canopy hectares of Hayward, yet to reach full production maturity and 2.53 canopy hectares of G3 Sungold, with half at full production. Last year about 11,000 trays were harvested from the G3 and in the past the fruit has received early start payments due to the orchard's peninsula location.</div><div></div><div>The kiwifruit is marketed and sold by co-operative Zespri, one of the world's leading horticultural companies and the recognised category leader in the fruit. It is also based in the region. The orchard owner has appreciated having easy access to packhouses and the port for exports.</div><div></div><div>“A savvy investor, corporate, trust or syndicate may see value in converting the entire orchard to Sungold kiwifruit and use the avocado and kiwifruit infrastructure, professional management and sophisticated industry structure for further investment and profit,” Mr Mangos said.</div><div></div><div>On the property, irrigation is from a hot water bore supplying three 35,000 litre storage tanks with the kiwifruit investment backed by a fully automated zoned frost protection system.</div><div></div><div>Sound infrastructure supports the orchard's production. It includes a large half round barn with a good load out area and used for machinery storage, equipment and fertiliser, a packhouse and office, a workshop, staffroom with laundry and bathroom, two 15,000 litre fertigation tanks and 1960s brick house built when the property was a dairy farm. It is now used for staff accommodation or could be utilised as an orchard manager's living quarters.  </div><div></div><div>The Bay of Plenty province is the country's biggest producer of avocados and kiwifruit. “New Zealand horticulture is a multi-billion dollar industry and the province contributes significantly to this,” Mr Mangos said.</div><div></div><div>“Key export markets have shown significant growth in the past 10 years and this is likely to continue. The kiwifruit industry's global revenue is expected to jump from more than $2 billion two years ago to $6 billion by 2030.”  </div><div></div><div>“Growers have shown a responsiveness to market demand and the sustained growth in the sector along with a positive outlook means the orchard's key attributes of scale, location, quality infrastructure, spectacular views and financial opportunities will make it a highly sought-after property,” he said.</div><div></div><div>“It is an exceptional opportunity for buyers to get into the avocado or kiwifruit sector with scale, or for those already in the industry to substantially grow their holdings.</div><div></div><div>“Although the attraction for investment and scope to maximise financial returns from this orchard is obvious, Mr Mangos said the picturesque waterfront location provides scope to also subdivide the land. The peninsula is a sought after destination with the property surrounded by premium housing and orchard enterprises.”</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/waterfront-orchard-an-opportunity-for-investors/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

It comprises a modern three storey building with retail on the ground and first levels. The second level was originally built as a roof top car park and then converted to purpose built offices for a government department in 2013.</div><div></div><div>Hamish Doig, managing director of Colliers International in Christchurch, is marketing the property in conjunction with director of retail leasing Nick Doig.</div><div></div><div>“The family is realising the estate and Mid City Centre is the proverbial jewel in the crown of the portfolio. Nam was a very astute investor and totally committed to the Christchurch CBD where he owned several properties over the decades. This is the first time the property has been available in more than 20 years.</div><div></div><div>“There’s growing investor interest in Christchurch, being fuelled by both private high net worth individuals and syndicators who are looking for a viable solution to their diminishing incomes due to falling interest rates. With the official cash rate at a record one per cent, depositors are feeling huge pressure to find alternative areas to place their capital. Commercial property is a natural home to satisfy this burgeoning demand.”</div><div></div><div>Earlier this year, Colliers sold the nearby EntX cinema complex on behalf of Calder Stewart for $48.4 million.</div><div></div><div>Located at 663 Colombo St, in the city block bounded by Lichfield, Colombo and Cashel Streets, Mid City Centre is flanked by two car park buildings comprising 1439 car parks and close to Cashel Mall, The Crossing and the new Riverside Farmers Market.</div><div></div><div>Nick Doig said national and international brands are now staking their claim in the Retail Precinct with the recent opening of Kate Sylvester and Kathmandu in Cashel Mall while General Pants, Decjuba and Platypus shoes will all be open shortly.</div><div></div><div>“A lot of brands were waiting to see how the Retail Precinct unfolded but they’re certainly now highly motivated to be in the CBD, encouraged by the culmination of several large projects. It means they can really see the shape of the city.”</div><div></div><div>Nam Yee was born in China and initially moved to New Zealand with his parents when he was 12 years old to flee the Japanese occupation. He attended Christ’s College from 1943 to 1945. He returned to China in 1945, after the end of the war, where he attended the influential Lin Ying university. But when the communists subsequently took hold of the south of China, Nam returned to make his life in New Zealand.</div><div></div><div>An ardent supporter of the inner city, Nam’s CBD portfolio also included 88 Cashel (the former Cafe Bleu and Bar) site, 92-94 Gloucester St (formerly Gloucester St Bar and Grill), 777 Colombo St (previously Mandarin Restaurant), and the Frontrunner building on the corner of Lichfield and Colombo Sts.</div><div></div><div>Nam always lived in the city and liked owning property in the CBD because they were all within walking distance of his home.  He enjoyed the exercise too and in the post-earthquake years would regularly walk around and watch all the new construction happening in the city.</div><div></div><div>The site at 88 Cashel Mall has been redeveloped since the earthquakes with a three storey building which is nearly complete.</div><div></div><div>The other three properties were acquired by the Crown.  The Frontrunner site is now home to the Bus Interchange, the Mandarin Restaurant land forms part of the Convention Centre, together with the Gloucester St Bar and Grill site.</div><div></div><div>The Mid City Centre property is now offered for sale by Deadline Private Treaty (unless sold prior) closing 4pm,October 31 2019.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/family-set-to-sell-mid-city-centre/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The supermarket lease generates approximately 80 percent of the total rental income. Its rent is reviewed every three years based on turnover while the other two leases have fixed annual increases of 2.0 and 2.5 percent.  </div><div></div><div>“The exterior of the Countdown property has recently been repainted and internally a pharmacy has been added to further enhance its appeal to customers who can get on with their grocery shopping while their prescriptions are being made up,” says Gorton.</div><div></div><div>MArk Walton, Bayleys Tauranga’s commercial manager, says the property’s prime location in the shopping centre, opposite one of its two main entranceways off Fraser Street, means it has high exposure to passing traffic and the centre’s customer base.</div><div></div><div>Fraser Cove was developed in 2002 by the New Zealand Retail Property Group (NZRPG), master developers of the Westgate Centre in Auckland, with an initial net lettable area of approximately 19,000 sq m and The Warehouse as its anchor tenant.  </div><div></div><div>\"It has subsequently expanded substantially into a 32,500 sq m retail and community hub with a variety of food and beverage outlets, a gymnasium and a range of speciality and large format retail stores,” says Walton.</div><div></div><div>“As befits its coastal location, Fraser Cove has a welcoming and beach-like feel, with brightly coloured paved pathways and palm trees winding through its carpark where over 1,000 free parking spaces are a major attraction for customers. Excellent transport links, including easy motorway access and nearby bus stops, means it’s highly accessible to a wide customer base and demographic.”</div><div></div><div>In addition to anchor tenants Countdown and The Warehouse, Fraser Cove Shopping Centre is also home to Warehouse Stationery, Kathmandu, North Beach, Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Big Save Furniture, Godfreys, Babycity, ToyWorld and Repco, with longstanding food and beverage tenants including the World’s End Sports Café bar and restaurant and Burger King.</div><div></div><div>Walton says the centre is well positioned between Tauranga’s central city and the densely populated residential suburbs of Tauranga South, Gate Pa, Parkvale and Greerton to the south.</div><div></div><div>“This is a well located asset in the heart of one of New Zealand's strongest and fastest growing regional economies, with Tauranga continuing to experience strong growth in population numbers up over 10 percent in the past four years,” he says.</div><div></div><div>“The area in which the property is situated is close to many of Tauranga’s most popular schools and major employment hubs such as the CBD and Tauranga Hospital plus a wide range of excellent restaurants and cafes. It is a location in constant demand by retailers, which is reflected in low vacancy rates.”</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/tauranga-retail-property-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

            "cleanhtml": "<font color=\"#000000\"><p>An easy care building with Plumbing World as the anchor tenant is on the market for sale in Thames.<br/> <br/>The low-maintenance 950 square metre property at 318-320 Pollen Street, reputedly the longest main street in the country's provincial towns, has two tenants returning yearly rent of $57,500 plus GST.<br/> <br/>Owned as a passive investment by a private investor, the 660-square metre building is mainly occupied by Plumbing World, which operates its business from a showroom, office, warehouse and yard, alongside ACC-approved Thames Acupuncture.<br/> <br/>The land and building are being marketed for sale by auction on December 5 through Bayleys Hamilton salespeople Josh smith and Jason Kong.<br/> <br/>Mr Smith said the property ticks all the right ownership boxes, with significant frontage offering good street appeal and exposure for both tenants and a seismic rating of 70 percent of new building standards.</p><p>\"The multi-tenanted property splits the risk,\" he said.<br/> <br/>Thames Acupuncture has adapted its tenancy into multiple patient rooms as well as an office and staff facilities providing privacy for clients and staff.<br/> <br/>Plumbing World, which has been at the site for more than two decades, has split a large open plan showroom and office area at the front from a separate warehouse at the back, maximizing its floor product display with minimal impact from the loading and unloading of products. The warehouse leads to a large 290-square metre secure fenced yard and a service lane giving easy access for inwards and outwards goods. <br/> <br/>The company's lease over the premises started in 2005 and was extended last year to 2029. It includes three three-year rights of renewal from February last year. Thames Acupuncture's lease started in 2016 and includes two four-year rights of renewal, with final expiry in 2026. Two-yearly rent reviews are included in both leases.<br/> <br/>Neighbouring tenants include plumbers Brokenshire &amp; Ross across the road and Reid Brothers Hardware, which has been in the same family for five generations, a couple of doors down.<br/> <br/>The historic-style building housing both Plumbing World and Thames Acupuncture was originally erected in 1968 as a shop and workshop. An extension was built in 1973 at 318 Pollen Street, with the two similar blocks connected in between by timber trusses. It has an internal staircase, lightweight roof, block cavity walls, concrete strip footings and steel frames.<br/> <br/>In keeping with the Shortland Heritage Area, the building has a bullnose canopy, fretwork detailing with chamfered posts and a wooden parapet completing the look. The settlement of Shortland was established in 1867 on the eve of the Thames gold rush. Later it was joined with Grahamstown to form Thames. <br/> <br/>Many of the buildings in the Pollen Street section of Shortland Heritage Area are notable for their early to mid-20th century architectural styling.<br/> <br/>Notable buildings in the area span the period from the late 1860s to the late 20th century, among them Arbury’s Buildings, the Chief Post Office and Thames War Memorial and Civic Centre. <br/> <br/>Pollen Street was named after Dr Daniel Pollen (1813 - 1896), a provincial and central government politician, who served as Premier of New Zealand for a brief time (1875-1876) As deputy superintendent of Auckland, Dr Pollen, with James Mackay, helped to negotiate the opening of the Thames goldfield.<br/> <br/>The Shortland Heritage Area embodies architectural values typical of a colonial settlement, where commercial buildings often evoke a classical aesthetic and restrict their embellishments to the façade.<br/> <br/>Pollen Street’s commercial buildings achieve a collective architectural significance given their general consistency of height, construction to the front of the lot and provision of a veranda. Although no building exceeds two storeys within the heritage area some of the commercial buildings have large parapets above the first floor, which gives them greater prominence within the streetscape.<br/> <br/>While the heritage area is significant to Thames, the town's community board looking to the future allocated $30,000 for Boffa Miskell to draw up concept plans for the revitalisation of the town centre.</p><p>Boffa Miskell designed the popular Whitianga town centre upgrade and its concept plans are expected to include a plaza in Mary Street at the intersection with Pollen Street, future use of the War Memorial Civic Centre and the building used by Wintec, which is owned by our council, as well as concepts for Pollen Street landscaping.</p><p>The community board will examine the concept plans in the next couple of months for possible inclusion in the council's 2021-31 Long Term Plan.</p><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/hands-off-provincial-investment/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

This classification allows for activities involved in the manufacturing, fabrication or processing of materials, as well as bulk storage and warehousing.</div><div></div><div>Five sites in the precinct have been sold, with two tenants already occupying a pair of purpose-built large warehouse units in the hub. The remaining 11 sections for sale within Waharoa Park range in size from 3,219 square metres up to 38,000 square metres and are being sold by negotiation through Bayleys Tauranga.</div><div></div><div>Commercial and industrial salesperson Graeme Coleman said the front sections within Waharoa Park faced onto Dunlop Road, while landholdings within the development were accessed off Mowatt Street which had been purpose built for the precinct. The sites are priced at between $90 - $140 per square metre depending on their size, and location within the precinct.</div><div></div><div>He said electricity and telecommunication utility services were installed to the boundary of each plot, with any new owner responsible for the installation of their own septic tank water systems. Waharoa Park had been laid out specifically with its own sedimentation ponds within the location to handle up to 75 percent of runoff.</div><div></div><div>In August, Matamata Piako District Council was awarded a provincial growth fund grant from the Government to study the potential for increasing the amount of industrial land at Waharoa– with the direct brief to develop a concept plan to an investment-ready state.</div><div></div><div>Up to $800,000 has been allocated to the project by the provincial growth fund, with an additional $100,000 pledged by Open Country Dairy, Inghams, Balle Bros and Waharoa Industrial Park. The Waharoa industrial growth project’s governing body consists of representatives from the local iwi, the Te Aroha Business Association, Matamamata-Pikao District Council, and the Te Waka economic development agency.</div><div></div><div>In announcing the grant, the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment said:</div><div>“The desired high level outcome is better integration of development and investment planning, leading to higher investment confidence, and few conflicts in resource use.  In turn this will lead to sustainable industrial hub expansion with local employment and skills development opportunities, improving prosperity for those people living in Waharoa and nearby environs - improving GDP and prosperity.”</div><div></div><div>“Waharoa and nearby Matamata are currently constrained by a lack of integrated land use, and the consequences that has for any development and investment planning. The outcome sought from the provincial growth fund ‘kick-start’ is to build investment confidence and resolve any potential conflict or hurdles arising in any applications for resourcing consent,” Mr Coleman said.</div><div></div><div>“While the provincial growth fund project will most likely open up more opportunity for such growth in the future, there is no timetable as to when any resulting land will transfer into industrial usage…. it could be years away.</div><div></div><div>“By comparison, being already consented for light industrial use, Waharoa Park is automatically at the bow-wave of this growth in industrial land usage - with sites in the development in a ready-to-build and occupy state now.”</div><div></div><div>Mr Coleman said the statistical data for the surrounding countryside could give some indication as to suitable tenancies for land and units within Waharoa Park – which was situated on thee T-junction of the Auckland to Tauranga railway line leading to the Kaimai tunnel.</div><div></div><div>“In and around Matamata there are 20 horse stud farms. Throughout the Waikato there are 7000 farms and 1.5 million cows, with approximately 10,000 hectares of cropping the likes of maize. potatoes and asparagus. So a business involved in the primary produce sector and based out of Waharoa would be in the hub of its target market.</div><div></div><div>“Alternatively, being in the middle of the motorway network linking Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga with locations to the south, Waharoa could evolve as a freight or logistics transfer station similar to the Stag Park Truck Stop on the periphery of Taupo.”</div><div></div><div>The benchmark for developing Waharoa into a rural industrial precinct was established some four years ago at the nearby North Waikato settlement of Kerepehi – where Hauraki District Council took a long-term business development approach to supporting the creation of a multi-tenanted food manufacturing and research hub in the enclave.</div><div></div><div>Hauraki District Council invested $9 million in upgrading Kerepehi’s water treatment plant to accommodate the forecast industrial growth in the food processing sector. The territorial authority  added a further substantial lure to attract new businesses to the town through the removal of development contribution fees - making it cheaper for developers to build new premises, and those cost-savings consequently being passed on to incoming tenants or owner/occupiers.</div><div></div><div>Dairy products manufacturer Allied Faxi Food was the first industrial business to take residency in Kerepehi’s industrial park – with four other industrial companies following suit, including a structural timber structural manufacturer which employs 23 staff.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/provincial-rural-industrial-hub-land-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The first section located on the eastern end is the raw materials and packaging store, with its own large load-in canopy.</div><div></div><div>Located in the middle is the 1,252 square metre processing area with the finished goods and load-out area on the western end. Canopies at both ends of the property cover 397 square metres, warehousing and storage 2,540 square metres, while there is also a 153 square metre service mezzanine.</div><div></div><div>Mr Ross said the property had full drive around facilities with separate entry and exit, ample yard space and the factory and warehouse/storage areas include alsynite topglass cool extreme roofing, a three-level containment system for chemical spills, and all new LED lighting installed earlier this year.</div><div></div><div>Innovations in the two-level office include concrete slab floors bringing reduced cooling demand, fibreglass wall, roof thermal and acoustic installation, reverse cycle regenerative heat pumps and solar water heating.  </div><div></div><div>The building was specifically designed to maximise reductions in energy and water consumption compared to standard buildings with strong attention to waste management. Features include two 30,000 litre tanks capturing water from the factory roof which is then filtered to provide process water.

However, this property  meets all of its current requirements and the company has been manufacturing and supplying products to the dairy industry for more than 30 years.</div><div></div><div>The company signed a five year lease in 2010 with two five-year rights of renewal due to run out in August 2025.

Salespeople Wayne Scurrah and Mark Morphy said the two locations were being offered for sale as one combined entity – operating seven-days-a-week.</div><div></div><div>“Back in 2014, the company’s founders saw that female-focused hair salons were capturing significant market share in men’s services because the typical barbershop operations around at that time simply weren’t up an acceptable professional standard befitting of the 2000s,” Mr Scurrah said.</div><div></div><div>“As a result, BarberShopCo was established to provide men with a salon experience, including a cut-throat razor shave, in a male-focused environment. The parent company’s vision is to deliver a world-class customer experience that is un-matched in New Zealand.</div><div></div><div>“Behind the scenes, the franchisor has invested in recruiting, staff training systems, and developing management policies and procedures reflective of a franchise organisation where consistent delivery of its unique client experience process is paramount.”</div><div></div><div>Mr Morphy said that since starting out as ‘haircut and shave’ purveyors, BarberShopCo’s operations had grown to encompass development of its own customised range of grooming products – ensuring retail sales are integrated into the client service.</div><div></div><div>“So not only does a BarberShopCo outlet derive revenues from delivering a haircut and shave, but it then has additional sales opportunities from the likes of shaving and hair-care products,” Mr Morphy said.</div><div></div><div>“Under the BarberShopCo model, it’s about owning the customers’ complete grooming service and retail experience.</div><div></div><div>“The business model plays on the convenience factor for customers, which is enormous…. where clients can source all their personal grooming product needs as part of an interaction with an expert rather than having to source products as part of the weekly grocery shopping.”</div><div></div><div>BarberShopCo has exclusive distribution rights for such premium imported products as equipment cleaning liquid Barbicide, and King Brown hair care treatment. In addition, the chain has created its own house brand under The Bowery label. All brands and retail products delivered the business what Mr Morphy called “exceptional margins” compared to other retail sectors.</div><div></div><div>“By utilising the combined purchasing power of the franchise structure, the company is able to provide its franchisees with healthy wholesale margins on their retail stock,” Mr Morphy said.</div><div></div><div>BarbershopCo Takapuna has a lease on its Lake Road location running through until 2022, with the landlord willing to discuss on-going rights of renewal with any potential new owner of the business.</div><div></div><div>Meanwhile, BarbershopCo Milford has a lease on its Lake Road location running through until 2021, with the landlord there also willing to discuss on-going rights of renewal with any potential new owner of the business. Mr Scurrah said both shops had exceptional fit-outs included in the sale - which would cost in the vicinity of $280,000 if setting up from new.</div><div></div><div>“The brand is a very slick operation – with stores outfitted to a replicated set design and service delivery format which features white tiled walls, wooden-framed mirrors at each workstation, classical-styled barbers chairs with branded towels over the arm rests when not in use, and staff attired in BarbershopCo’s branded full apron uniform,” he said.</div><div></div><div>“The model is designed so that no matter which BarberShopCo outlet a customer walks into, they received exactly the same degree of attention and service in a familiar environment.”</div><div></div><div>Trading accounts from the combined Takapuna and Milford BarberShopCo business reflected a forecast growth of eight percent for the coming full financial year compared with the just completed financial year. Mr Scurrah said that the Takapuna/Milford business operating at full staff capacity was forecast to deliver an owners surplus well in excess of $200,000 in the current financial year.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/male-grooming-businesses-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The property features in Bayleys’ latest Total Property portfolio magazine.</div><div></div><div>Cameron Melhuish and James Chan of Bayleys Auckland are marketing the property, which has frontages to Whitford Road and Meadowland Drive and services a significant and affluent residential catchment area that includes Botany Downs, Dannemora, Sommerville, Howick, Cockle Bay and Whitford.</div><div></div><div>The plaza has a Grade A+ seismic rating and 5,215sqm of lettable retail area spanning an 18,860sqm freehold site with more than 200 customer car parks.</div><div></div><div>Melhuish says the Meadowlands Shopping Plaza has proved to be a perennially popular community hub since established in the early-1990s and an extensive refurbishment programme eight years ago further enhanced its appeal for tenants and shoppers.</div><div></div><div>“This plaza bucks the trend of some New Zealand suburban shopping centres in having a strong sense of purpose, long-term tenants and solid patronage,” says Melhuish.</div><div></div><div>“As a shopping and service centre, the plaza has cemented a proven place in the local market as a convenient and reliable shopping destination with more than 20 businesses within the complex.”</div><div></div><div>Although the east Auckland area is well-serviced by retail hubs, Melhuish says Meadowlands Shopping Plaza has consistently attracted both a solid tenant base and a loyal customer following.</div><div></div><div>“It is not intended to compete with the likes of the nearby Botany Town Centre which is positioned as a retail, lifestyle and leisure offering with civic and community amenities.</div><div> </div><div>“Rather, Meadowlands Shopping Plaza is a service-orientated complex with the essentials for residents in the catchment area, where parking is plentiful and a number of household service-tasks can be completed in one shop/stop.”</div><div></div><div>Countdown, the New Zealand subsidiary of publicly-listed Australian company, Woolworths Limited – which operates a chain of 180 grocery stores nationwide – has anchored the Meadowlands Shopping Plaza for close to 30 years, initially-operating under the Woolworths brand.</div><div></div><div>With seven years remaining on its Meadowlands’ lease, the supermarket’s presence in the shopping centre underpins cashflow for investors in the long-term with the property returning a net income of $1,314,267 plus GST per annum.</div><div></div><div>Meadowlands Pharmacy was also a founding tenant within the plaza and along with the busy AA Centre, helps to support the convenience retail-service focus of the complex.</div><div></div><div>The balance of the tenants within the plaza include specialty stores across the food and beverage, beauty and health, gifts and stationery, and service sectors.</div><div></div><div>Bayleys Property Services has managed the Meadowlands Shopping Plaza on behalf of its landlord owners for 10 years, and Melhuish says since January 2018, it’s successfully leased or executed rights of renewal for 12 tenancies within the shopping centre.</div><div></div><div>“This clearly demonstrates the popularity of the plaza among its business tenants and reinforces its reputation as a sought-after retail environment with low vacancy.</div><div></div><div>“There’s currently just 164.1sqm of vacant retail space within the centre which is expected to be leased up in the near future.</div><div></div><div>“The high level of facility management expertise in place via the current management agreement makes this a truly hands-off, passive investment and allows an owner to comfortably park this in the bottom drawer.”</div><div></div><div>The large, high-profile site has exposure to an average of 25,900 vehicles daily, with dual road frontages and access points.</div><div></div><div>Melhuish says the flexible and adaptable Business-Local Centre zoning on the flat site adds another level of future value for a new owner.</div><div></div><div>“While the existing long-term leases mean that any wholesale changes will not be possible in the short-term, this site has potential that could be unlocked over time,” he explains.</div><div></div><div>“The Business-Local Centre zoning designation primarily provides for the local convenience needs of surrounding residential areas, including retail, commercial services, offices, food and beverage, and appropriately-scaled supermarkets.</div><div></div><div>“Under the Auckland Council unitary planning guidelines, designated local centres are aimed to consolidate fundamentals to provide an attractive place to live, work and visit.</div><div></div><div>“With changing dynamics in suburban centres Auckland-wide, and growing demand for housing, the expansion of existing local centres will be deemed appropriate if it would provide greater social and economic well-being benefits for the community.</div><div></div><div>“This local centre zoning typically allows buildings up to four storeys high, with residential use on upper floors permitted.”</div><div></div><div>Melhuish says as an income-producing centre, the plaza will appeal to traditional retail investors, whilst also providing significant holding income/cashflow for developers and land bankers looking at potential future development options for the site.</div><div></div><div>“A flat site of this size in an area known for having a strong demographic catchment, with residents recorded as having above-average median incomes and where house values underpin confidence in the suburb, makes this a compelling investment opportunity.”</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div

The Weighted Average Lease Term (WALT) based on income is over six years, providing long-term income with most leases providing sustained rental growth prospects,” says Binning.</div><div></div><div>“What’s more, with one of the properties completely vacant and additional leasing of smaller units required, the value of the assets has the ability to increase through new long-term leases with rental upsides.”</div><div></div><div>In terms of the buildings, 79-81 is the one completely vacant asset and presents 964sqm of lettable area with a large stud height, open floorplate, and natural light generation through the exposed ceiling windows and heightened glass frontage. The space has the ability to take on a number of uses with two smaller rooms located at the rear with a kitchen, bathroom and storage area in place.</div><div></div><div>83 Victoria Avenue is home to AMI Insurance as the sole tenant. The 288sqm retail space was built in 1980 and received a refurbishment in 2013 with an upgrade of the air conditioning and installation of automatic doors.</div><div></div><div>85-97 Victoria Avenue has six individual tenancies across approximately 1,168sqm of lettable area. Two of the units are currently vacant, with the other tenancies leased to Spark, Flight Centre, Specsavers, and Cactus Crème Café. The largely square site was completed in 2015 and has been constructed to a high and modern specification.</div><div></div><div>And finally, 101-105 Victoria Avenue sits on the corner with Maria Place, offering a high profile for anchor tenant ANZ Bank. The rectangular site was constructed in 2009 with more than 901sqm of lettable area and 22 carparks at its rear.</div><div></div><div>JLL Commercial Broker John McKenzie says together, the portfolio brings in an annual rental income of more than $720,000, but it has the potential to significantly raise this with the vacant space in addition to the favourable location.</div><div></div><div>“Victoria Avenue is considered the main retail strip of the Whanganui area accommodating both internationally renowned brands, national tenants and some local businesses,” says McKenzie.</div><div></div><div>“Within the vicinity of the assets is a variety of greenspace including Queens Park, Majestic Square, the Moutoa Gardens and the Cooks Gardens Athletics dome. The area has the highest levels of foot traffic in the city and with ample on-street parking, the strip is easily accessible by cars and public transport.”</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/whanganui-retail-portfolio-for-sale/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The property features in Bayleys’ latest Total Property portfolio magazine. </div><div></div><div>Smith said a new owner could develop the front of the property immediately or run Amberjack's lease out and redevelop the entire property.</div><div></div><div>“The property owner decided not to put any new buildings on the site as he now has business interests in Auckland,”  Smith said.</div><div></div><div>Zoned commercial (8A), the property fronts both Belmont Rd and Willoughby St giving dual access and high exposure to passing vehicle and foot traffic.</div><div></div><div>After re-purposing the existing concrete wall warehouse with an iron roof, Amberjack uses the premises to produce small batch room sprays and candles by hand.</div><div></div><div>The company signed a two-year lease in June last year including two two-year rights of renewal, with operating expenses included in the rent and rent reviews at the time of lease renewal.</div><div></div><div>“While the warehouse holds a seismic rating of 42 per cent of New Building Standard, the owner said simple bracing and strengthening could bring this to more than 67 per cent,”  Smith said.</div><div></div><div>“With the potential to use the existing tenancy and develop the vacant land bordering State Highway 2, or land bank, the possibilities in the town self-proclaimed as the antiques capital of New Zealand are burgeoning.”</div><div></div><div>Paeroa is a regional hub and its slogan is “The Best Little Town in the Middle of Everywhere”. It is known for many things, for being  the events capital of Coromandel, the giant L&amp;P bottle, the Maritime Park and Museum, the Karangahake Gorge and the Hauraki Rail Trail.</div><div></div><div>The rail trail's easy grade and great scenery covers 82km  from Thames to Paeroa, Paeroa to Waihi and then to Te Aroha.  Smith said it  averages 10,000 visitors a month and more than 12,000 visitors in the peak summer months.</div><div></div><div>The Hauraki District Economic Development unit said there was a demand for more than 200 visitor beds in  the district, and  Smith said Paeroa was an ideal place for much of that accommodation.  </div><div></div><div>“A backpackers/cyclists' lodge, or a budget motel incorporating an upmarket cafe could be operated from the site, or a small retail development with a range of different shops,”  Smith said.</div><div></div><div>“The accommodation doesn't have to be of ‘Hilton’ standard, but homely-type run by friendly people interested in what the rail trail offers cyclists.”</div><div></div><div>The economic development unit said a local Paeroa developer had set up a café/bar/restaurant business and added 14 motel rooms behind to cater for accommodation demand, and the elderly owners of a hobby cafe business in the town spotted an opportunity to provide Devonshire teas to hungry cyclists passing through. </div><div></div><div>“There are many opportunities to add value to the rail trail while at the same time running a profitable business,”  Smith said.</div><div></div><div>Another alternative, he said, could be small units for a range of different trades as the town goes through a building phase with a 45-lot housing subdivision springing up on what was once was a car park at the old race course on the corner of Thames and Raroa Rds. </div><div></div><div>The land had been zoned residential for 20 years before anybody took the plunge to develop it and it will provide work opportunities for local contractors and lead to new residents living and doing business in Paeroa,  Smith said.</div><div></div><div>Also under development is a nearby retirement  village on vacant land at Waimarei Ave that will require local tradesmen and contractors. When finished, the proposed Longridge Country Estate will have 250 units, as well as a 60-bed aged care facility with rest home, hospital, and dementia care. Resource consent has been granted for the first 68 units.</div><div></div><div>The development will also include a comprehensive luxury recreation and community centre, with a restaurant, cafe, bowling green, croquet, library, picture theatre, full-size snooker table, doctors’ rooms, hairdressing salon and computer room.</div><div></div><div>Paeroa has also hit the jackpot from Shane Jones' Provincial Development Fund, with more than $700,000 provided to the maritime park marine development project, which will require construction trades workers when it gets underway.</div><div></div><div>Seventeen kilometres away, in the tiny town of Kerepehi, once considered a Waikato economic backwater, there will be substantial building work at 23 industrial building sites opposite an old dairy factory converted into the first Chinese-owned export-focused ice cream factory in New Zealand. </div><div></div><div>Seven of the sites — which range in size from 2020sq m to 12,392sq m  — were sold through Bayleys Hamilton. Proposed structures range from large steel and aluminium framed warehousing and logistics facilities, through to specialised workshops and design/builds.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/riding-the-rail-trails-success-to-new-property-ventures/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Yields are holding or firming up and there’s a confident view in the long term of the industrial property sector.</div><div></div><div>“The recent drop in the OCR to one per cent has boosted that even further. We’re noticed a dramatic increase in people looking for good investment stock since that announcement. </div><div></div><div>“We are also seeing good bank support for the right assets and the right ownership structure. The problem is that it’s really hard to find good very many good assets for sale and there are definitely far more buyers than sellers. Investors seem to be holding back their stock at the moment.”</div><div></div><div>With that in mind, Staite expects this trend will fuel interest in a prime industrial warehouse at 14 Braeburn Drive in Hornby, one of the highest growth and rapidly evolving industrial areas of Christchurch. </div><div></div><div>The property has been home to Steel &amp; Tube Holdings Ltd’s reinforcing division for the past 13 years. It is for sale by deadline private treaty, closing September 25, unless sold prior.</div><div></div><div>“Now surplus to requirements, the property is to be sold with vacant possession. This could represent an opportunity for a business to secure a modern building in a very tightly held location, where few other existing buildings are available.”</div><div></div><div>Conventional in design, the building is situated on a large freehold parcel of 11,565sq m and features a low ratio of office to warehouse, high stud warehousing with one centre row of columns, two gantry bays with cranes, excellent drive through access and good hardstand lay-down areas.</div><div></div><div>Staite says: “The Hornby location has matured and improved greatly over the past 10 years with a large amount of new development and refurbishment of older facilities. Hornby continues to be one of the most sought after commercial/ industrial areas in Christchurch. </div><div></div><div>“The bustling Hornby retail precinct is another lure for investors, coupled with the roading improvements which are a big driver for industrial demand. The upgrade of Halswell Junction Road has greatly improved the flow of traffic and the upcoming opening of the Southern Motorway Stage 2 will be a game changer for traffic heading to Rolleston and beyond.”</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/growing-demand-from-owner-occupiers-for-industrial-property/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

Most of the recent sales we’ve been involved in had tenants that were in the early stages of leases of between 12 and 15 years. </div><div></div><div>“Properties with these sort of lease terms are less likely to be exposed to any downturn in the market over the next few years. </div><div></div><div>“Many of the leases also have fixed rental increases, in addition to rent reviews to market. This means they provide assured, steady rental growth which will provide most future capital growth given that yields are unlikely to go much lower.”</div><div></div><div>Recent sales that Chaudhary, Weng and Darji have been involved in include:</div><div></div><div>• 512 sq m premises in Anzac Rd, in Browns Bay’s town centre, purpose built in 2014/15 and licenced for 97 children, sold for $3.760m  at a 6.4% yield sold. Occupied by Choice Education with a 12-year lease until 2030 </div><div>• 170sqm converted bungalow licenced for 40 children on a 751sqm residential site in Locket Rd, Glenfield, sold in conjunction with Michael Nees, Bayleys North Shore for $1.690m at a 5.32% yield.  Educare Kids has a 15-year lease until 2034. </div><div>• Another North Shore childcare centre licenced for 50 children sold for $3.080m  at a 4.99% yield. It has a new 12-year lease to an established operator. </div><div>• SugarTree Lane Preschool centre in Nelson St, in Auckland’s CBD, sold for $3.010m  at a 7.42% yield with Damien Bullick and James Chan, Bayleys Auckland Central. An initial 15-year lease runs until 2033.</div><div>• Two Choice Kids Childcare Centres in South Auckland both licenced for 90 children sold to separate purchasers at a combined value of $6m. Located in Roscommon Rd, Clendon, and Alfriston Rd, Manurewa East, each sold at a 7.03% yield on new 15-year leases from March 2018. These are among seven centres occupied by Choice Kids in South Auckland that Chaudhary’s team has sold over the past year. </div><div>• A centre licenced for 50 children above a small complex of retail shops in Lincoln Rd sold for $1.560m. The relatively short remaining term of less than five years on an initial 10-year lease to Discoveries Educare was reflected in an 8.03% yield. </div><div></div><div>Chaudhary says the early childhood education (ECE) sector is underpinned by strong support from central Government which funds up to 20 hours of ECE a week for children aged three to five.</div><div></div><div>“Both National and Labour governments have recognised the vital role the ECE sector plays in helping shape our citizens of the future and they would risk a big voter backlash if there was any watering down of current subsidies. </div><div></div><div>“In fact, as has been the case with maternity leave provisions, there is more likely to be increasing support for the sector.”</div><div></div><div>Chaudhary says there has been a proliferation of childcare centres in recent years, particularly in Auckland where this has accompanied substantial population growth, which has created some “growing pains” for the industry. </div><div></div><div>However, he says there are a number of barriers to entry which should help constrain over-supply in the longer term.  </div><div></div><div>“Obtaining resource consent for a childcare property is generally more challenging than for say an industrial or office building. </div><div></div><div>“Then there are licencing and compliance issues that have to be dealt with. It’s also not as easy to make money in ECE as some people seem to think and we can expect to see some weeding out of weaker players.” </div><div></div><div>Chaudhary says he and his team will have a variety of centres coming on the market shortly, in Ellerslie, Herne Bay and Mt Wellington. </div><div></div><div>“The owners of these properties are looking to make the most of the current high level of unsatisfied demand for childcare centres and which is likely to result in strong competition for these offerings.”  </div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/flurry-of-childcare-sales/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"

The lease's expiry date is November 2024 and rent reviews are done on the renewal of the lease every three years.</div><div></div><div>Occupying the front third is NV Motorcycles, separated from Morrinsville Hire by its own security fence and gate. The premises have undercover storage for motorbikes and ATVs and large workshop and retail space. It is the only local dealership that sells Husqvarna Motorcycles, Motoguzzi and Can-Am off road all-terrain vehicles.</div><div></div><div>“The property, with a commercial (8A) zoning, has significant frontage to Thames St and rear access to Anderson St, giving it dual entry and high visibility from the nearby State Highway 26, which links Morrinsville and Hamilton,”  Smith said.</div><div></div><div>“It's prominent position will make it attractive for a wide range of tenants, including, farm-related retail, automotive businesses, farm machinery, a veterinary clinic, or light industrial. It is surrounded by farm machinery company Norwood, PGG Wrightson, farm stores and across the road Annah Stretton Fashion.</div><div></div><div>“Given an extensive refit, the premises could become destination retail, for example, a small specialised garden centre with possibly a cafe attached,  or any type of small town rural business. </div><div></div><div>“Morrinsville is one of the most intensively farmed areas in the world and as a service centre for the local dairy industry, many of the town's businesses are geared towards supporting it and associated rural activities.”</div><div></div><div> Smith said a new owner, with attractively fitted out premises, could attract a tenant  willing to pay a higher rent. </div><div></div><div>“If the new owner was looking for premises for their own business it would be just a matter of being patient for a few months before being able to move in,” he said.</div><div></div><div>Morrinsville fits into the district council's town strategies 2013-2033 document forecasts population growth of 44-55 households annually and it outlines plans for business expansion.</div><div></div><div>The town's business zone comprises a 1.5 km linear strip of land straddling Thames St, between Canada St in the east and Avenue Rd in the west. </div><div></div><div>Expansion involves an area west of Marshall St, along Avenue Rd, away from Thames St, which is more commercial in character with a mix of uses including the stockyards, grain storage, service industry, and the motor trade, and has land zoned business, but is still largely vacant.</div><div class=\"share-strip\">\n<h3>Share</h3>\n<div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"addthis_sharing_toolbox\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"TrueCommercial\" data-src=\"http://truecommercial.oneroof.co.nz/insights/news/property-articles/terminating-lease-drives-opportunities-for-rural-investors/?news=0&amp;p=1&amp;pp=799\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div></font>"
